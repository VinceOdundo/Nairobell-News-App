It argued that no customs documents or proof of concealment were ever submitted in court, and that the charge sheet was procedurally flawed, lacking proper endorsement when amended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>IPOB Status and Proscription Challenged</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referencing a 2017 ruling by Justice Binta Nyako, the group insisted that IPOB is not an unlawful society. The ruling, made in an open court with both parties present, has never been overturned. The subsequent proscription of IPOB by the federal government, it claimed, was obtained ex parte, without the group’s representation — a move the statement argued violates both Nigerian constitutional guarantees and international legal standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EndSARS Allegations Rejected</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The directorate also pushed back against efforts to link IPOB or its leader to the EndSARS protests, calling such claims “false and defamatory.” It cited findings from the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry, which pointed fingers at Nigerian security forces—not IPOB—for the violence and fatalities that occurred during the protests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reiterating a longstanding claim, the group condemned Kanu’s “extraordinary rendition” from Kenya to Nigeria in 2021, calling it an illegal abduction that violated both domestic and international law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It drew parallels with the landmark Dikko v. State (1984) case, in which the Supreme Court of Nigeria discharged a northern Nigerian man abducted from the Republic of Niger, solely on the grounds that his extradition was illegal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Justice Garba Mohammed, who ruled that Kanu could still be tried despite the illegality of his rendition, owes the Nigerian public and international community an explanation,” the statement said. “Is there one law for the Sahel North and another for the South-East?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IPOB Directorate called on the Nigerian government to:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respect due process and Kanu’s fundamental rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>End the reliance on repealed laws and politically motivated prosecutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cease the media trial and propaganda tactics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group also urged journalists, civil society, and the international community to scrutinize the case more closely and advocate for “justice rooted in truth and the rule of law.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement comes amid growing local and international attention on the trial, with concerns mounting over alleged violations of legal norms and human rights in the handling of the case.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/06/ipob-legal-directorate-debunks-charges-against-nnamdi-kanu/\">IPOB Legal Directorate debunks charges against Nnamdi Kanu</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>",

She was hit by a speeding 4&#215;4 towing a jet ski along the shore.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Converging reports suggested the case was a hit-and-run accident, but the father initially clarified that the suspect was the one who drove him with his daughter to the hospital, as his car was far away and blocked by other vehicles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his new post on Facebook, the father said the driver is also being prosecuted while in custody and did not flee the scene on the day of the accident, as claimed by some pages and social media posts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case is handled by the judiciary and is following the correct legal course, the father said, apologizing to his friends and the press, contacting Ghita’s family for an interview, noting that he is unable to do any interviews for now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My daughter has been discharged and is with me now. We couldn’t take the pressure at the clinic anymore… We’re taking care of her at home now, especially since her mental state has really deteriorated as she keeps asking ‘Why do I look like this?”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The father also warned citizens that neither he nor his wife asked for financial help.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As for the people who created pages under Ghita’s name and are asking for financial help- be careful!!! Neither my wife nor I has a TikTok account. Our Instagram accounts are private. And we have not asked for any kind of financial assistance,” the father concluded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case of Ghita swept social media across Morocco, especially after the father appeared in an interview last week, demanding justice following the accident.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moroccans launched a social media <a href=\"https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2025/06/219795/justicepourrita-moroccans-demand-justice-for-4-year-old-toddler-after-tragic-beach-accident/\" target=\"_blank\">campaign</a> under the hashtag Justice for Ghita following the father’s interview, during which he said members of the suspect’s said they have money and there is nothing that could be done against the driver.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This came after the suspect’s family members visited the clinic to check on Ghita.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“One of my relatives: ‘The guy who committed this crime should be punished.’”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, one of his family members allegedly stated outright that nothing could be done “because they have money.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It means that our daughter’s life does not matter to them.  They believe they can prove their son’s innocence with money. I haven’t gone to my house for a week.. I cannot go home,” the father added, in tears.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He also said in his previous interview that the suspect’s legal team has allegedly attempted to blame the father, accusing him of not watching his daughter closely enough.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2025/06/220086/4-year-old-ghitas-health-condition-is-improving-after-tragic-beach-accident/\">4-Year-Old Ghita’s Health Condition is Improving After Tragic Beach Accident</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.moroccoworldnews.com\">Morocco World News</a>.</p>",

I want to appeal to drivers, especially commercial drivers, to value lives. One mistake can cost several lives,” he stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fire Officer indicated these on Friday at Kenyasi in the Ahafo region in an interview with JoyNews on the increasing incidents of road crashes in the enclave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An accident involving a tipper truck and a Toyota Yaris had happened on Ntotroso-Kenyasi road in the area, claiming 2, with three others admitted at Banhart and Kenyasi District hospitals, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two out of five in the taxi (Toyota Yaris with a registration number BA-876-21) were confirmed dead on the spot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The taxi collided with a tipper truck with a registration number, GR-7768-25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DO11 Emmanuel Quansah further emphasised the need for passengers and pedestrians to be alert and play their part in ensuring safety on the roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Passengers should speak up when drivers are misbehaving. We all have a role to play. Let’s avoid unnecessary speeding, follow traffic signals, and ensure our vehicles are in good condition,&#8221; he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to him, the Fire Service in Asutifi North will continue with its public education campaigns and collaborate with the police, transport unions, media and other stakeholders to reduce road crashes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DO11 Emmanuel Quansah emphasised that this is an important reminder for all of us that safety begins with the individual and that there is a need to adhere to road safety regulations, saying, &#8220;Let’s all play our part and stay alive.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Let God put this one in our hands; let&#8217;s finish him.” </p>\n<p>In another clip, a man accused Ortom of causing Benue’s problems and praised the current governor for allowing Fulanis to live in peace.</p>\n<p>BAN said these videos confirm that Fulani extremists are still planning to harm Chief Ortom. </p>\n<p>The group added that Ortom’s only offense was standing firm to protect his people from invasion during his time as governor.</p>\n<p>“Chief Ortom resisted attempts to repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law of 2017 despite pressure from Fulani leaders. He refused to betray the people of Benue,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>BAN also listed past threats and attacks on Ortom, including the 2021 assassination attempt claimed by the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM), who openly said: “Our intention is unequivocal: TO KILL HIM.”</p>\n<p>The group condemned the silence of Fulani leaders and elites who, according to them, have continued to profile Ortom and blame him for resisting Fulani occupation of Benue lands.</p>\n<p>They demanded the arrest of those behind the threat videos.</p>\n<p>“They posted the videos themselves, so it should not be hard to trace and arrest them.”</p>\n<p>BAN also urged the Inspector General of Police and the Department of State Services (DSS) to beef up security around Ortom and his family.</p>\n<p>The group further warned that Fulanis should not think they have a monopoly of threats and intimidation.</p>\n<p>“We want to unequivocally state that the threats by Fulanis against Chief Samuel Ortom cannot be taken lightly. The descendants of Usman Dan Fodio are known for monitoring their targets for as long as it takes. But what Fulani terrorists must understand is that they will have all of us Benue people who supported Governor Ortom and demanded the enactment of the law to ban open grazing to contend with.</p>\n<p>“Fulanis should not think they have a monopoly on threats and intimidation. Chief Ortom cannot be vilified and eliminated for doing what any good and patriotic leader would do for his people.</p>\n<p>“Ortom did what the people of Benue asked him to do, and he owes no Fulani terrorist an apology. He rejected the billions of naira they promised him, among other juicy offers, and refused to betray his people.</p>\n<p>‘Millions of Benue people are grateful to Chief Ortom and stand solidly behind him. No weapon fashioned against him by Fulani terrorists and their sponsors shall prosper,” the statement reads in part.</p>\n<p>The group demanded the deployment of armed security personnel along the Makurdi-Lafia road where terrorists are said to be targeting Tiv travelers.</p>\n<p>They also called on the Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, to help flush out terrorists from border forests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2025/06/23/arrest-extremists-threatening-ortom-in-new-video-ban-tells-security-agencies/\">Arrest extremists threatening Ortom in new video &#8211; BAN tells security agencies</a></p>",

In some areas they charge you according to the quantity of what you want to&nbsp;grind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While others will tell you that the cost of fuel, maintenance of the commercial&nbsp;grinding&nbsp;machine, rent of space is taking a toll on them, hence they increase the price of&nbsp;grinding&nbsp;no matter what the quantity is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mrs Judith Amadi, a crayfish seller, noted that the high cost of tomatoes and pepper made her stop patronizing the commercial grinders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don&#8217;t have money to buy tomatoes and peppers everyday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So I stopped patronizing commercial&nbsp;grinder&nbsp;and started using my traditional&nbsp;grinding&nbsp;machine that I abandoned at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don&#8217;t have a&nbsp;grinding&nbsp;stone which I would have preferred most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I now use the corona&nbsp;grinder&nbsp;for almost every&nbsp;grinding&nbsp;including leaves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is because I don&#8217;t have an electric blender and if you even have one you will be scared of using it, especially when you are using a prepaid meter, in order to manage electricity units.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now that tomatoes and pepper are very expensive,&nbsp; the&nbsp;grinder&nbsp;has stopped wastage because those commercial ones will get your tomatoes and pepper stuck&nbsp; inside with most of it&nbsp; leaking from the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The quantity of waste is higher than the quantity you get after the whole process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Also, it has erased the cost of&nbsp;grinding&nbsp;in my budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A few&nbsp; years ago,&nbsp; you could&nbsp;grind&nbsp;your tomato pepper mixtures for N50 but now the price ranges from N300 to N500 depending on the area excluding quantity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you want to blend leaves and other things,&nbsp; you have to pay N800 above.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The traditional manual&nbsp;grinder&nbsp;is a&nbsp;grinder&nbsp;made of steel and found in every home in the 90&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is mostly used to blend grains like melon, ogbono, dry pepper and other spices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,&nbsp; the advent of modern blenders has made most households abandon the traditional one to explore technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the current state of living has halved the hope of many households who now return to the once abandoned traditional manual grinders to cut costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mrs. Omolara Ayotunde, a commercial tomato&nbsp;grinder, complained about the low patronage experienced whenever there is tomato and pepper price hike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In the season when tomatoes and pepper are expensive,&nbsp; people hardly&nbsp;grind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Many prefer using traditional manual grinders while those well to do people use electric blenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If I were not a commercial&nbsp;grinder, I would do the same too to avoid waste of tomatoes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most of these commercial grinders after a long time of usage develop faults and in such situations waste anything one&nbsp;grind&nbsp;in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On the cost of&nbsp;grinding,&nbsp; everybody knows that things are expensive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“After a day&#8217;s work , the profit I make is nothing to write home about.&nbsp; It is very poor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Expenses like fuel cost, water, space rent, maintenance cost are what I face especially now that there is low patronage.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/06/local-grinding-stones-return-as-cost-of-grinding-tomatoes-provokes-housewives/\">Local grinding stones return as cost of grinding tomatoes provokes housewives</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>",

Iran, a sovereign nation, now holds every legal and moral right to defend itself and reconsider its NPT membership, as the U.S. and Israel have endangered its supreme national interests through this act of aggression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Racist, Colonialist Disregard for International Law</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, including the fortified Fordow facility, and Israel’s coordinated assault are not isolated acts but part of a broader racist and colonialist agenda to subjugate non-Western nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These attacks, executed without evidence of an imminent threat from Iran, violate Article 51 of the UN Charter, which permits military action only in response to an armed attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump administration and Israeli leadership have provided no credible justification for their aggression, relying instead on decades-old tropes demonising Iran as a threat to global order— a narrative rooted in Orientalist prejudice that paints Middle Eastern nations as inherently dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU’s failure to condemn Israel’s surprise attack on Iran exposes its complicity in this colonialist framework. While quick to sanction nations like Syria or Venezuela, the EU’s silence on Israel’s aggression reflects a racist hierarchy that privileges Western-aligned states over others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This double standard echoes the colonial era, when European powers justified their domination of non-Western peoples under the guise of “civilising” missions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi rightly called the U.S. and Israeli actions a “grave violation” of international norms, underscoring Iran’s right to pursue all options to defend its sovereignty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Article 10 of the NPT, Iran may withdraw if “extraordinary events” jeopardise its supreme interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. and Israeli assaults on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure facilities, verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for peaceful use, qualify as such events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran’s potential exit from the NPT would be a direct result of Western aggression, destabilising the non-proliferation framework that the U.S. and EU claim to champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By attacking Iran, the West has not only violated the NPT but also pushed Tehran toward a nuclear deterrent to counter imperialist threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Iran’s Right to Self-Defence</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Iran has an inherent right to self-defence against the U.S. and Israeli onslaught. Iran’s missile strikes on Israeli military and civilian infrastructure, reported on June 22, 2025, demonstrate its resolve to resist colonialist aggression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following successful strikes highlight Iran’s capacity to challenge the Zionist regime’s hubris:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Israeli Ministry of Interior building was struck, disrupting administrative functions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Kirya, the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, suffered ballistic missile damage, crippling Israel’s military command.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An IDF base in the Negev Desert and the Gav Yam Negev Advanced Technologies Park, housing military and cyber facilities, were targeted, undermining Israel’s technological superiority.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Bazan Oil Refinery in Haifa was hit, causing pipeline damage and a shutdown, severely impacting Israel’s energy sector.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Port of Haifa and Haifa Oil Refinery were struck, disrupting economic lifelines.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Weizmann Institute of Science, a cornerstone of Israel’s military technology, was destroyed, costing billions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Residential areas in Haifa, Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv, and Beit She’an were hit, reflecting the consequences of Israel’s escalation.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Soroka Medical Centre in Be’er Sheva sustained significant damage and a suspected chemical leak.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Colel Chabad Daycare Centre was struck by cluster munitions, exposing Israel’s indiscriminate tactics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These strikes reveal Israel’s fragility as its air defence systems, including the Iron Dome, are overwhelmed. With Ben Gurion Airport shut down and civilian infrastructure crumbling, Israel is facing the repercussions of its zionist arrogance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran’s response is a legitimate exercise of self-defence, aimed at deterring a regime that has assassinated Iranian scientists, bombed its facilities, and collaborated with Western powers to enforce a racist hierarchy in the Middle East.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consequences of Western Aggression</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strikes on Iran are not merely military actions but a continuation of a racist, colonialist agenda to dominate the Global South. By deploying B-2 stealth bombers and bunker-busting bombs, Trump has betrayed his anti-war rhetoric, aligning with Israel’s supremacist policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strikes have killed over 400 Iranians, predominantly civilians, including 54 women and children, according to Iran’s Ministry of Health. Israel’s attacks on Iranian fuel depots, airports, and public buildings risk an environmental catastrophe, further punishing a nation targeted for its refusal to bow to Western hegemony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU’s silence emboldens this aggression, signalling to non-Western nations that their sovereignty is secondary to Western interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia and China have condemned Israel’s strikes, with President Vladimir Putin calling them “highly dangerous” and President Xi Jinping urging a ceasefire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The G7’s failure to issue a unified statement reflects Trump’s isolationist recklessness, prioritising military dominance over diplomacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S., Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced the strikes as an unconstitutional act of war, warning of global instability.</p>",

It is also able to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and fix it in the soil, reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” An agronomist at the CRI, Dr. Eric Owusu Danquah, highlighted.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Scientists make case for intercropping amidst climate change impacts\" class=\"wp-image-10032785185\" height=\"576\" src=\"http://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-23-at-09.09.10-1024x576.jpeg\" title=\"Scientists make case for intercropping amidst climate change impacts\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dr. Eric Owusu Danquah, an agronomist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the demonstration field, the alley of maize crops grown together with pigeon pea was protected against rainstorms, securing the roots of the maize firmly in the group.

Her maize grew beautifully even though the rains were erratic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If it had rained regularly, I would have harvested large sacks of maize this year. But even with the little rains, my farm looks greener,” She noted while recalling a poor harvest in the previous crop season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rains aren’t the only troubles confronting farmers and bringing about lower yields.

But others sharply criticized the decision, said they want to see more explanation than his brief Saturday night speech, or warned of a drawn-out conflict.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Ahead of Saturday’s bombing, the prospect of United States involvement in another Middle Eastern conflict had opened rifts in the GOP. Trump himself had ripped the United States’ involvement in wars in the Middle East as a presidential candidate, and his “Make America Great Again” movement includes many more isolationist voices aligned with his “America First” vision. Those voices were at odds in recent days with GOP hawks who advocated a muscular US role in supporting Israel in its bid to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">But after Trump’s Saturday night announcement, some prominent MAGA voices rallied around the president.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“Iran gave President Trump no choice,” <a href=\"https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1936577404585353644\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said Charlie Kirk</a>, a pro-Trump media personality and founder of the activist group Turning Point USA.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“For a decade he has been adamant that Iran will never get a nuclear weapon. Iran decided to forego diplomacy in pursuit of a bomb. This is a surgical strike, operated perfectly,” Kirk said Saturday on X. “President Trump acted with prudence and decisiveness.”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/matt-gaetz-withdrawing-attorney-general\">who withdrew</a> as Trump’s first selection for attorney general, compared on X the president’s bombing of Iran to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/02/middleeast/baghdad-airport-rockets\">his first-term killing</a> of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, which was met with some predictions that it would ignite a regional conflict that did not come true.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“President Trump basically wants this to be like the Soleimani strike &#8211; one and done. No regime change war,” Gaetz said Saturday night <a href=\"https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1936573842312540301\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on X</a>. “Trump the Peacemaker!”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">However, on Sunday, Gaetz expressed skepticism toward any broader mission in Iran.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“Just remember: every regime change war has been extremely popular at the start. But the historical trajectory isn’t good.” he <a href=\"https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1936779672320114705\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said on X,</a> later <a href=\"https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1936805940004569363\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">adding</a>: “There will always be another Iranian mountain to bomb for the neocons.”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a staunch Trump ally, <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FRepMTG%2Fstatus%2F1936564082477531596&amp;data=05%7C02%7CGreg.Clary%40cnn.com%7Cfc29410ea0784fa1d5a108ddb1addb01%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638862082434149053%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=3acUg6guMLoxQDMH3JA8DDdG9vqPq6F2djNqEkLDMcY%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted Saturday night</a> on X: “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first. Israel is a nuclear armed nation. This is not our fight. Peace is the answer.”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">It’s too early to tell how the American public — and particularly those within Trump’s MAGA movement — will react to the United States’ bombing of Iran.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">On Wednesday, before the bombing, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2025/iran-strike-us-involvement-poll/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post one-day survey</a> of Americans, conducted with SSRS, found that 45% opposed US airstrikes against Iran, 25% supported airstrikes and 30% were unsure. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say they viewed Iran’s nuclear program as a serious threat, and more likely to support airstrikes. Polls conducted in one day can be subject to larger potential errors than those fielded over multiple days, since not everyone selected to participate may be available to respond on that single day.</p>\n<div class=\"image image__hide-placeholder image--eq-extra-small image--eq-small image--eq-large\">\n<div class=\"image__container \"><source media=\"(max-width: 479px)\" type=\"image/webp\" /><source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" type=\"image/webp\" /><source media=\"(min-width: 960px)\" type=\"image/webp\" /><source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"This satellite image shows the Fordow enrichment facility in Iran after US strikes, Sunday, June 22, 2025.\" class=\"image__dam-img\" height=\"1316\" src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/fordow-marked2-1.png?q=w_1110,c_fill\" width=\"2163\" /></div>\n<div class=\"image__metadata\">\n<div class=\"image__caption attribution\"><span class=\"inline-placeholder\">This satellite image shows the Fordow enrichment facility in Iran after US strikes, Sunday, June 22, 2025.</span></div>\n<p>Maxar Technologies/CNN</p></div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Some prominent figures in Trump’s MAGA movement called for the president to delve into more detail on his decision to step directly into what had been a conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and now a pro-Trump podcaster, said Saturday night that the president has “some work to do” to explain his decision to supporters.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“I do think that the president’s got to have a little deeper explanation of this — particularly why it looks like we’re doing the heavy lifting for Israel,” he said on his podcast shortly after Trump addressed the nation Saturday night.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">He also said he was concerned with “incrementalism” and the prospect of the United States entering a “forever war” if Iran retaliates and the US takes further action.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">And he warned that being pulled into a Middle Eastern conflict could distract from Trump’s domestic agenda.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“This is how you don’t focus on sanctuary cities. This is how you don’t focus on the great big, beautiful bill — everything you need to do,” Bannon said. “Not that it’s wrong to take these actions. Sometimes you must take these actions. I think President Trump came to the conclusion that he had to take these actions.”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump commentator, sought to portray Trump’s bombing of Iran as one intended to accomplish a specific target, rather than the first step in a longer-term effort to oust Iranian leadership.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“President Trump has clearly signaled, as he has all along, that he opposes a regime change war in Iran. This is about the nuclear program of Iran which he promised he would end from day one,” Posobiec wrote on X.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Laura Loomer, a pro-Trump activist who said the president “just saved us all from a nuclear holocaust” by bombing Iran, noted the silence from some in Trump’s movement who had opposed US involvement.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“Can someone please conduct a wellness check on Tucker Carlson, Dave Smith, Candace Owens and the entire MAHA crew?” she wrote on X, making reference to the “Make America Healthy Again” movement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. supporters who backed Trump.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Carlson, a former Fox News host and one of the loudest voices opposing US involvement in Iran, as of late Sunday morning had said nothing on social media about Trump’s bombing.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Owens, a conservative commentator who said on her YouTube show last week that “MAGA was a declaration of war on neocons” and accused Trump of fracturing his base, was perhaps the most vocal critic Saturday.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Owens, who regularly expresses anti-Israel views, pointed to the $100 million that pro-Israel donor Miriam Adelson gave a pro-Trump super PAC during the 2024 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“If we had raised the 100 million Adelson gave him on Go Fund Me, maybe he would have kept his promises,” she wrote on X. “Guess we’ll never know.”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">She also called his post on Truth Social announcing the bombing “utterly deranged.”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Trump, for his part, said the GOP was behind him and called for passage of his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/21/politics/senate-trump-agenda-bill\">massive tax and spending package</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“Great unity in the Republican Party, perhaps unity like we have never seen before. Now let’s get the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill done. Our Country is doing GREAT.

It is the foundation of every successful industrialised nation. Without trained technicians, artisans, and engineers, there can be no mining, no construction, no manufacturing,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Samuel Aboagye stated that developing countries must stop treating vocational training as second-class education</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted that Ghana’s mining industry continues to rely heavily on technically trained personnel, many of whom are products of local vocational institutions, warning that ignoring the potential of TVET is a missed opportunity for national transformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We need more investments in TVET infrastructure, modern tools, and trainer capacity. Governments must create policies that empower our youth to become job creators through skills, not just certificate holders,&#8221; the National Secretary emphasised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Samuel Aboagye has therefore called on educational stakeholders, policymakers, and development partners to mainstream TVET into all aspects of national development, including the mining sector and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said if developing nations want to build sustainable economies, they must begin with skilled hands, insisting that TVET is the backbone of real development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

Federick Igwiwiyisi vs Osaro Uwaifo &amp; 2 ORS (CA/ABJ/CV/869/2024) – Judgment delivered on September 6, 2024, with an appeal dismissed by the Supreme Court on February 26, 2025, in SC/CV/922/2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Action Alliance &amp; 3 ORS vs INEC &amp; 3 ORS (CA/ABJ/CV/1163/2024) – Judgment delivered on November 13, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The party emphasized that the Certified True Copies (CTCs) of the Court of Appeal judgments have been made public and conclusively resolved the party’s leadership dispute in favour of Chief Udeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AA further accused some individuals of seeking to undermine these appellate rulings by securing a conflicting decision from the Federal High Court in Osogbo—a move the party described as legally untenable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is elementary law that a Federal High Court cannot overturn a decision of the Court of Appeal. The ruling from the Osogbo court holds no weight when there are higher court decisions already in place,” the party asserted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The party disclosed that it had already filed motions to set aside the Federal High Court ruling and for a stay of execution, while also formally notifying INEC not to act on that judgment in violation of the judicial hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement concluded by recalling that the AA held its National Convention on February 22, 2025, where Chief Udeze’s leadership was reaffirmed for a fixed term in office. The convention, the party noted, was duly monitored by INEC, and the commission’s monitoring report is also available as a Certified True Copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Action Alliance urged INEC to maintain its neutrality and respect the rule of law by upholding the leadership structure validated by the courts and monitored by its officials.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/06/dont-tamper-with-our-leadership-list-action-alliance-warns-inec/\">Don&#8217;t tamper with our leadership list, Action Alliance warns INEC</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>",

      "description": "This strategic policy document presents a comprehensive framework for embedding ethical AI principles into Ghana's public procurement ecosystem.",
      "content": "<img alt=\"Embedding Ethical AI in Public Procurement: Ghana&#039;s path to trustworthy automation in E-governance\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1127-150x150.png\" title=\"Embedding Ethical AI in Public Procurement: Ghana&#039;s path to trustworthy automation in E-governance\" width=\"150\" />\n<p>Ghana stands at a critical juncture in its digital transformation journey. As the nation advances its e-governance initiatives through platforms such as the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) and digital procurement reforms led by the Public Procurement Authority (PPA), the integration of artificial intelligence presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant risks (Public Procurement Authority, 2023). The automation of procurement processes—from vendor registration and bid evaluation to contract monitoring and compliance auditing—holds the promise of enhanced efficiency, reduced corruption, and improved transparency. However, without robust ethical frameworks and explainability standards, AI-driven procurement systems risk perpetuating bias, undermining public trust, and creating opaque decision-making processes that contradict the very principles of accountable governance they were designed to uphold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategic policy document presents a comprehensive framework for embedding ethical AI principles into Ghana&#8217;s public procurement ecosystem. Drawing from international best practices including the OECD Recommendation on AI in the Public Sector (2021), the European Union AI Act (2024), and Singapore&#8217;s Model AI Governance Framework, this analysis proposes tailored guidelines that address Ghana&#8217;s unique institutional context whilst positioning the nation as a regional leader in trustworthy AI governance (OECD, 2021; European Union, 2024; IMDA, 2020). The urgency of this initiative cannot be overstated. As procurement processes increasingly rely on algorithmic decision-making for vendor selection, risk assessment, and contract evaluation, the absence of ethical safeguards poses systemic risks to Ghana&#8217;s democratic governance and economic development objectives. This document therefore advocates for a proactive, multi-stakeholder approach that treats AI not merely as a technological tool, but as a transformative governance force requiring careful institutional oversight and public accountability mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. The Imperative for Ethical AI in Public Procurement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.1 AI as a Systemic Governance Transformation Force</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration of artificial intelligence into public procurement represents far more than technological modernisation—it constitutes a fundamental transformation in how governments make decisions that affect millions of citizens and billions of cedis in public resources (World Bank, 2023). In Ghana&#8217;s context, where public procurement accounts for approximately 50-70% of government expenditure, the deployment of AI systems in vendor selection, bid evaluation, and contract monitoring processes has profound implications for economic equity, competitive fairness, and democratic accountability (Public Procurement Authority, 2022).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contemporary AI applications in procurement encompass predictive analytics for demand forecasting, natural language processing for contract analysis, machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, and automated scoring systems for vendor evaluation (Stanford HAI, 2023). Whilst these technologies offer substantial benefits in terms of processing speed, consistency, and analytical capacity, they also introduce new categories of risk that traditional procurement oversight mechanisms are ill-equipped to address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.2 The Trust Deficit Challenge</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public trust in government institutions fundamentally depends on the perceived fairness, transparency, and accountability of decision-making processes (MIT Technology Review, 2024). When AI systems make or significantly influence procurement decisions without adequate explainability mechanisms, citizens, vendors, and oversight bodies are unable to understand, challenge, or validate the reasoning behind crucial allocations of public resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This opacity problem is particularly acute in contexts where historical data used to train AI models may reflect past discriminatory practices or systemic biases against certain demographic groups, geographic regions, or business categories (Barocas et al., 2019). In Ghana&#8217;s case, where regional development disparities and informal-formal economy divisions create complex procurement equity challenges, AI systems trained on biased historical data risk perpetuating or amplifying existing inequalities rather than promoting more equitable resource allocation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Embedding Ethical AI in Public Procurement: Ghana&#039;s path to trustworthy automation in E-governance\" class=\"wp-image-10032785150\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1126.png\" title=\"Embedding Ethical AI in Public Procurement: Ghana&#039;s path to trustworthy automation in E-governance\" width=\"936\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.3 Constitutional and Legal Imperatives</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghana&#8217;s constitutional commitment to transparency, accountability, and equal treatment under the law creates clear legal imperatives for ethical AI deployment in public procurement (Constitution of Ghana, 1992). Article 296 of the Constitution mandates that public procurement must be conducted in a manner that ensures value for money, fairness, and transparency. Similarly, the Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843) establishes principles for lawful, fair, and transparent data processing that directly apply to AI systems handling procurement-related personal and commercial data (Data Protection Commission, 2012).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663) further reinforces requirements for open, competitive, and accountable procurement processes that must be preserved and enhanced rather than undermined by AI automation (Parliament of Ghana, 2003). These existing legal frameworks provide a strong foundation for developing AI ethics guidelines, but require updating and specification to address the unique challenges posed by algorithmic decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Current Risks and Vulnerabilities in AI-Enhanced Procurement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.1 Data Bias and Discriminatory Outcomes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant risks in AI-driven procurement systems lies in the potential for biased data to produce discriminatory outcomes that violate principles of fair competition and equal treatment (Selbst et al., 2019). In Ghana&#8217;s procurement context, several categories of bias warrant particular attention:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Geographic Bias</strong>: Historical procurement data may reflect past preferences for vendors from certain regions, particularly the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions, where business registration and capacity development have been more robust. AI systems trained on this data risk systematically disadvantaging qualified vendors from Northern Ghana, Upper East, Upper West, and other underserved regions, thereby perpetuating regional development inequalities (Ghana Statistical Service, 2021).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sectoral Bias</strong>: Traditional procurement processes may have favoured certain types of businesses or industrial sectors based on historical relationships, political considerations, or administrative convenience rather than merit-based criteria. AI systems that learn from these patterns risk embedding sectoral preferences that lack rational justification and may violate competitive neutrality principles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scale Bias</strong>: Procurement data often reflects preferences for larger, more established companies that have greater capacity to navigate complex bidding processes and maintain extensive documentation. Whilst scale considerations may be legitimate for certain procurements, AI systems may inappropriately generalise these preferences to contexts where smaller enterprises could provide better value or where supporting SME development is a policy objective.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Embedding Ethical AI in Public Procurement: Ghana&#039;s path to trustworthy automation in E-governance\" class=\"wp-image-10032785146\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1125.png\" title=\"Embedding Ethical AI in Public Procurement: Ghana&#039;s path to trustworthy automation in E-governance\" width=\"936\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.2 Algorithmic Opacity and Accountability Gaps</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;black box&#8221; nature of many machine learning algorithms presents fundamental challenges to procurement accountability and oversight mechanisms (Rudin, 2019). When AI systems make vendor selection recommendations or automatically score bid proposals, the reasoning behind these decisions may be opaque even to the procurement officers implementing them. This opacity creates several critical problems:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audit Trail Deficiencies</strong>: Traditional procurement auditing relies on the ability to trace and validate the reasoning behind procurement decisions. When AI systems make recommendations based on complex algorithmic processes that cannot be readily explained or reconstructed, audit institutions such as the Auditor-General&#8217;s office face significant challenges in fulfilling their oversight mandate (Auditor-General, 2023).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Appeal and Review Complications</strong>: Ghana&#8217;s procurement framework provides mechanisms for vendors to appeal procurement decisions and seek administrative or judicial review. However, when decisions are made or significantly influenced by AI systems whose reasoning cannot be adequately explained, the fundamental right to understand and challenge governmental decisions is undermined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance Monitoring Difficulties</strong>: Effective procurement management requires ongoing assessment of vendor performance, contract outcomes, and system effectiveness. Opaque AI systems make it difficult to identify when algorithmic decision-making is producing suboptimal results or to implement necessary corrections and improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.3 Data Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI systems in procurement typically process vast quantities of sensitive commercial and personal data, including proprietary business information, financial records, and personal details of company directors and key personnel (NIST, 2023). This data concentration creates significant security and privacy risks:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Commercial Confidentiality</strong>: Vendors must often provide detailed financial, technical, and strategic information as part of procurement processes. AI systems that process this data must implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorised access, industrial espionage, or competitive disadvantage resulting from data breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal Data Protection</strong>: In accordance with Ghana&#8217;s Data Protection Act, AI systems must ensure that personal data of individuals involved in procurement processes is collected, processed, and stored in compliance with data protection principles (Data Protection Commission, 2012). This includes ensuring data minimisation, purpose limitation, and appropriate retention periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cross-Border Data Transfers</strong>: Many AI procurement platforms involve cloud computing services or algorithmic processing that may result in data transfers outside Ghana&#8217;s jurisdiction. Such transfers must comply with data protection requirements and may require additional safeguards to protect commercial and personal information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.4 Vendor Gaming and System Manipulation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophisticated AI systems may be vulnerable to gaming strategies where vendors attempt to manipulate algorithmic decision-making processes by optimising their submissions for AI scoring criteria rather than substantive procurement requirements (Kleinberg et al., 2020). This presents several risks:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Criteria Optimisation</strong>: If AI scoring algorithms weight certain factors heavily, vendors may artificially inflate these aspects of their proposals whilst neglecting other important considerations, leading to suboptimal procurement outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adversarial Attacks</strong>: More sophisticated actors may attempt to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in AI algorithms to gain unfair advantages in competitive bidding processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Information Asymmetries</strong>: Vendors with better understanding of AI systems or greater technical resources may gain systematic advantages over competitors, undermining competitive fairness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. National AI Ethics Guidelines for Public Procurement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.1 Foundational Principles Framework</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building upon international best practices and Ghana&#8217;s constitutional values, this framework proposes six foundational principles for ethical AI in public procurement:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparency and Explainability</strong>: All AI systems used in procurement processes must provide clear, understandable explanations for their recommendations and decisions. This includes documentation of algorithmic logic, data sources, weighting criteria, and decision pathways that can be reviewed by procurement officers, vendors, auditors, and oversight bodies (OECD, 2021).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fairness and Non-Discrimination</strong>: AI systems must be designed and implemented to ensure equal treatment of all qualified vendors regardless of geographic location, business size, ownership characteristics, or other factors not directly relevant to procurement criteria. Regular bias testing and fairness auditing must be integral to system design and operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accountability and Human Oversight</strong>: While AI systems may provide recommendations and analytical support, final procurement decisions must remain subject to meaningful human review and approval. Procurement officers must retain the authority and capability to override AI recommendations when circumstances warrant, and clear accountability chains must be maintained for all procurement outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Protection and Privacy</strong>: All AI systems must comply fully with Ghana&#8217;s Data Protection Act and implement privacy-by-design principles that minimise data collection, ensure secure processing, and respect commercial confidentiality requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reliability and Robustness</strong>: AI systems must be thoroughly tested, validated, and monitored to ensure consistent, accurate performance across diverse procurement contexts. Regular performance reviews, error detection mechanisms, and continuous improvement processes must be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Proportionality and Human-Centric Design</strong>: The deployment of AI in procurement must be proportionate to the benefits achieved and must always serve to enhance rather than replace human judgement in complex procurement decisions. AI systems should augment human capabilities whilst preserving space for professional discretion and contextual consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.2 Specific Implementation Standards</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Algorithmic Impact Assessments</strong>: Prior to deployment, all AI systems used in procurement must undergo comprehensive impact assessments that evaluate potential effects on competition, equity, efficiency, and procedural fairness. These assessments must be conducted by independent experts and made publicly available subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explainability Requirements</strong>: AI systems must provide explanations at multiple levels of detail:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summary Explanations</strong>: High-level rationales for recommendations that can be understood by procurement officers and vendors without technical expertise</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Detailed Technical Documentation</strong>: Comprehensive algorithmic specifications, data processing procedures, and weighting methodologies for use by auditors and technical oversight bodies</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Individual Decision Explanations</strong>: Specific rationales for particular procurement decisions that explain how vendor characteristics and proposal elements influenced algorithmic assessments</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bias Testing and Fairness Auditing</strong>: Regular testing protocols must be established to identify and address potential biases in AI systems:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pre-deployment Testing</strong>: Comprehensive bias assessment using historical data and simulated scenarios before system implementation</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ongoing Monitoring</strong>: Continuous assessment of AI system outputs for patterns that may indicate discriminatory treatment</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>External Auditing</strong>: Annual independent reviews by qualified experts to assess fairness and identify improvement opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Governance Standards</strong>: Robust data management protocols must ensure:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Data Quality</strong>: Regular validation and cleaning of training and operational data to minimise errors and biases</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Data Lineage</strong>: Clear documentation of data sources, processing steps, and transformations</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Access Controls</strong>: Strict limitation of data access to authorised personnel with legitimate business needs</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retention Policies</strong>: Appropriate data retention and deletion schedules that balance operational requirements with privacy principles</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.3 Sector-Specific Guidelines</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Construction and Infrastructure Procurement</strong>: Given the high value and complexity of infrastructure projects, AI systems in this sector must incorporate additional safeguards including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Enhanced environmental and social impact considerations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialised technical capability assessments</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Long-term sustainability and maintenance factor weighting</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Community engagement and local content requirements</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goods and Services Procurement</strong>: For routine goods and services procurement, AI systems may operate with greater automation whilst maintaining:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Regular human review of algorithmic recommendations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clear escalation procedures for unusual or high-value procurements</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vendor feedback mechanisms to identify potential system errors or biases</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Emergency and Crisis Procurement</strong>: In emergency situations, AI systems must be designed to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Expedite processing whilst maintaining essential oversight mechanisms</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incorporate crisis-specific evaluation criteria</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide clear audit trails for post-crisis review and accountability</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Institutional Collaboration Framework</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.1 Inter-Agency Coordination Mechanisms</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective implementation of ethical AI in public procurement requires unprecedented coordination between multiple government agencies, each bringing distinct expertise and regulatory authority. This framework proposes the establishment of a National AI Procurement Governance Council comprising representatives from:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Public Procurement Authority (PPA)</strong>: As the lead agency responsible for procurement policy and oversight, PPA will serve as the primary implementing body for AI ethics guidelines. PPA&#8217;s role includes developing technical standards, training procurement officers, and monitoring compliance across MDAs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Protection Commission</strong>: Responsible for ensuring AI systems comply with data protection requirements, conducting privacy impact assessments, and investigating complaints related to data handling in AI procurement systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA)</strong>: Contributing expertise on vendor verification, tax compliance checking, and financial risk assessment while ensuring AI systems support rather than complicate revenue collection objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ministry of Finance</strong>: Providing strategic oversight, budget allocation for AI system development and maintenance, and coordination with international development partners supporting digital governance reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>GIFMIS Technical Team</strong>: Offering technical expertise on financial system integration, ensuring AI procurement tools interface effectively with existing financial management systems, and maintaining data integrity across platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.2 Civic Tech Community Engagement</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghana&#8217;s vibrant civic technology community represents a crucial resource for developing, testing, and monitoring AI procurement systems. This framework proposes several engagement mechanisms:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Open-Source Development Partnerships</strong>: Collaborating with organisations such as Code for Ghana and the Ghana Tech Lab to develop open-source AI tools that prioritise transparency and community oversight whilst meeting government procurement requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Public Algorithm Auditing</strong>: Establishing partnerships with academic institutions and civil society organisations to conduct independent audits of AI procurement systems, providing external validation of fairness and effectiveness claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Civic Oversight Mechanisms</strong>: Creating formal channels for civil society organisations to monitor AI procurement system performance, report potential biases or errors, and contribute to continuous improvement processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Digital Literacy and Capacity Building</strong>: Partnering with civic tech organisations to develop public education programmes that help citizens understand AI procurement systems and participate meaningfully in democratic oversight processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.3 International Collaboration Networks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghana&#8217;s AI procurement reform efforts should be embedded within broader international cooperation frameworks that facilitate knowledge sharing, technical assistance, and policy learning:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>African Union Digital Transformation Strategy</strong>: Aligning Ghana&#8217;s AI procurement policies with continental frameworks for digital governance and contributing to regional standard-setting processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Commonwealth Digital Governance Network</strong>: Leveraging shared legal traditions and administrative systems to learn from AI procurement experiences in countries such as Singapore, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>World Bank Digital Government Platform</strong>: Participating in global knowledge networks that facilitate technical assistance, peer learning, and capacity building support for AI governance reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>OECD AI Policy Observatory</strong>: Engaging with international best practice development even as a non-OECD member, contributing African perspectives to global AI governance discussions, and accessing technical resources for policy development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Global Best Practice Analysis</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.1 OECD Framework for AI in Public Sector</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence (2021) provides comprehensive principles for responsible AI deployment in government contexts that offer valuable guidance for Ghana&#8217;s procurement reform efforts. Key elements particularly relevant to procurement include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Human-Centred AI Values</strong>: The OECD framework emphasises that AI systems should benefit people and the planet by augmenting human capabilities and enhancing human decision-making rather than replacing human judgement entirely (OECD, 2021). In procurement contexts, this translates to AI systems that support procurement officers with better data analysis and risk assessment whilst preserving human authority over final decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robustness and Safety</strong>: OECD guidelines require AI systems to function reliably throughout their lifecycle and include mechanisms for addressing errors, biases, and unintended consequences. For procurement applications, this means implementing comprehensive testing protocols, continuous monitoring systems, and rapid response mechanisms for addressing algorithmic failures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparency and Explainability</strong>: The OECD framework mandates that AI systems provide meaningful transparency appropriate to their context and the level of risk they pose. High-stakes procurement decisions require detailed explainability mechanisms that allow stakeholders to understand and challenge algorithmic recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.2 European Union AI Act Implementation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU AI Act (2024) represents the world&#8217;s most comprehensive regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, offering detailed guidelines for high-risk AI applications that directly apply to public procurement systems (European Union, 2024). Several provisions are particularly relevant:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Risk-Based Regulatory Approach</strong>: The EU Act classifies AI systems according to risk levels, with public procurement systems typically falling into &#8220;high-risk&#8221; categories that require extensive oversight, documentation, and compliance mechanisms. Ghana can adopt similar risk classification approaches to prioritise regulatory attention on the most consequential AI applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conformity Assessment Requirements</strong>: High-risk AI systems under EU law must undergo conformity assessments that evaluate compliance with safety, performance, and ethical requirements before deployment. Ghana could implement similar pre-deployment review processes for procurement AI systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Post-Market Monitoring</strong>: The EU framework requires ongoing monitoring of AI system performance after deployment, including incident reporting, performance tracking, and regular compliance reviews. These mechanisms could be adapted for Ghana&#8217;s procurement oversight infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments</strong>: For AI systems that may affect fundamental rights, the EU requires detailed impact assessments that evaluate potential effects on human dignity, privacy, non-discrimination, and other constitutional values. Similar assessments could strengthen Ghana&#8217;s constitutional compliance mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.3 Singapore&#8217;s Model AI Governance Framework</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singapore&#8217;s approach to AI governance emphasises practical implementation guidance rather than rigid regulatory requirements, offering a flexible framework that may be particularly suitable for Ghana&#8217;s developing institutional context (IMDA, 2020). Key elements include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Voluntary Best Practices</strong>: Rather than mandatory regulations, Singapore provides detailed guidance on AI ethics implementation that organisations can adapt to their specific contexts, whilst demonstrating responsible AI practices to stakeholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Self-Assessment Tools</strong>: Singapore has developed practical self-assessment frameworks that organisations can use to evaluate their AI systems against ethical principles and identify areas for improvement. Similar tools could support Ghana&#8217;s MDAs in implementing AI procurement reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sector-Specific Guidance</strong>: Singapore provides tailored guidance for different sectors and applications, recognising that AI ethics requirements vary significantly across contexts. Ghana could develop similar sector-specific guidance for different types of procurement (construction, goods, services, emergency procurement).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Innovation-Friendly Approach</strong>: Singapore&#8217;s framework emphasises supporting innovation whilst managing risks, providing guidance that helps organisations deploy AI responsibly without excessive regulatory burden. This approach may be particularly valuable for Ghana&#8217;s efforts to attract investment and build technical capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.4 South Korea&#8217;s Digital Procurement Transformation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea&#8217;s comprehensive digitalisation of public procurement through the Korea ON-line E-Procurement System (KONEPS) offers valuable lessons for AI integration in procurement processes (Kim &amp; Lee, 2022). Key insights include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Digital Integration</strong>: South Korea achieved significant efficiency gains by digitalising all aspects of procurement from vendor registration through contract management, creating comprehensive data foundations that enable effective AI applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vendor Capacity Building</strong>: South Korea invested heavily in helping vendors, particularly SMEs, develop digital capabilities required to participate effectively in electronic procurement systems. Ghana could implement similar capacity-building programmes to ensure AI procurement systems do not inadvertently exclude qualified vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance-Based Evaluation</strong>: South Korea&#8217;s system emphasises objective, performance-based vendor evaluation criteria that reduce subjective judgement and potential corruption whilst providing clear foundations for AI system development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continuous System Improvement</strong>: South Korea maintains ongoing system enhancement processes that incorporate user feedback, performance data, and technological advances. Similar continuous improvement mechanisms could ensure Ghana&#8217;s AI procurement systems remain effective and responsive to changing needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Building Public Confidence and Democratic Accountability</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6.1 Transparency and Public Engagement Strategies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public confidence in AI-driven procurement systems fundamentally depends on citizen understanding and trust in these technologies. Ghana must therefore implement comprehensive transparency and engagement strategies that go beyond technical compliance to build genuine public buy-in for AI governance reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Public Algorithm Registries</strong>: Ghana should establish publicly accessible registries that document all AI systems used in procurement processes, including their purposes, data sources, decision-making criteria, and performance metrics. These registries should provide information at multiple levels of technical detail to serve different stakeholder needs, from general public understanding to detailed technical review by experts and auditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Citizen Education Programmes</strong>: Comprehensive public education initiatives should help citizens understand how AI systems work, what benefits they provide, what risks they pose, and how democratic oversight mechanisms protect public interests. These programmes should be delivered through multiple channels, including traditional media, social media platforms, community meetings, and school curricula.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vendor Outreach and Support</strong>: Systematic outreach programmes should ensure that potential vendors, particularly SMEs and businesses from underserved regions, understand how AI procurement systems work and have access to support for effective participation. This includes technical assistance, training programmes, and clear guidance on how AI systems evaluate proposals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Civil Society Partnership</strong>: Formal partnerships with civil society organisations should create ongoing channels for public input, independent monitoring, and advocacy for continuous improvement in AI procurement systems. These partnerships should include representation from diverse constituencies, including business associations, regional development organisations, and citizen advocacy groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6.2 Parliamentary and Judicial Oversight Mechanisms</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghana&#8217;s constitutional system of checks and balances requires adaptation to address the unique challenges posed by algorithmic decision-making in public procurement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Parliamentary Committee Oversight</strong>: Parliamentary committees responsible for public accounts and procurement oversight should receive enhanced technical support and training to effectively monitor AI procurement systems. This includes regular briefings on system performance, bias testing results, and compliance with ethical guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Judicial Review Procedures</strong>: Courts hearing procurement-related cases should have access to the technical expertise necessary to evaluate AI-driven decisions and assess compliance with procedural fairness requirements. This may require specialised training for judges, technical advisory services, or specialised tribunal procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Auditor-General Capacity Building</strong>: The Auditor-General&#8217;s office must develop new capabilities for auditing AI procurement systems, including technical expertise, algorithmic auditing tools, and updated audit methodologies that address the unique challenges of algorithmic decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Independent Oversight Bodies</strong>: Consideration should be given to establishing independent technical oversight bodies with expertise in AI systems that can provide ongoing monitoring, investigation of complaints, and technical advice to constitutional oversight institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6.3 Performance Measurement and Accountability Frameworks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robust accountability for AI procurement systems requires comprehensive performance measurement frameworks that track not only efficiency gains but also compliance with ethical principles and constitutional values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Performance Indicators</strong>: Ghana should develop comprehensive KPIs for AI procurement systems that measure:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Efficiency Metrics</strong>: Processing time reduction, cost savings, administrative burden reduction</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fairness Metrics</strong>: Geographic distribution of procurement awards, SME participation rates, bias testing results</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Transparency Metrics</strong>: Public satisfaction with information provision, vendor understanding of processes, complaint resolution times</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quality Metrics</strong>: Procurement outcome satisfaction, vendor performance, value for money achievement</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Regular Public Reporting</strong>: Annual public reports should provide comprehensive assessments of AI procurement system performance, including challenges encountered, improvements implemented, and plans for future development. These reports should be presented to Parliament and made widely available to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Independent Evaluation</strong>: Periodic independent evaluations by external experts should assess overall system performance, compliance with ethical guidelines, and alignment with Ghana&#8217;s development objectives. These evaluations should inform continuous improvement processes and policy updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Implementation Roadmap and Capacity Building</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7.1 Phase One: Foundation Building</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial phase focuses on establishing institutional foundations, developing technical capabilities, and creating policy frameworks necessary for ethical AI procurement implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Institutional Setup</strong>: Establish the National AI Procurement Governance Council with representatives from PPA, Data Protection Commission, GRA, Ministry of Finance, and GIFMIS teams.

Share lessons learned and contribute to regional best practice development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: Establish permanent continuous improvement processes that incorporate ongoing performance monitoring, stakeholder feedback, technological advances, and evolving best practices into system development and policy refinement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7.4 Capacity Building Priorities</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technical Skills Development</strong>: Ghana must invest heavily in developing technical capabilities across government institutions to effectively implement and oversee AI procurement systems. Priority areas include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Data Science and Analytics</strong>: Training for procurement officers and analysts in data interpretation, statistical analysis, and performance measurement</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AI Ethics and Governance</strong>: Specialised training for policy makers, oversight personnel, and legal staff on AI ethics principles, bias detection, and algorithmic accountability</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cybersecurity and Data Protection</strong>: Enhanced capabilities for protecting sensitive procurement data and ensuring AI system security against external threats and internal misuse</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Institutional Culture Change</strong>: Implementing ethical AI in procurement requires significant changes in institutional culture and operating procedures:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration</strong>: Training programmes that help procurement officers work effectively with AI systems whilst maintaining appropriate human oversight and decision-making authority</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Transparency and Accountability</strong>: Cultural changes that emphasise proactive transparency, public engagement, and accountability for algorithmic decision-making outcomes</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continuous Learning</strong>: Institutional cultures that embrace experimentation, learning from failures, and continuous improvement in AI system design and implementation</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Public Sector Leadership</strong>: Ghana&#8217;s AI procurement reforms require strong leadership at all levels of government:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Executive Leadership</strong>: High-level political commitment to ethical AI principles and willingness to invest in necessary institutional changes</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Administrative Leadership</strong>: Strong leadership from heads of MDAs, procurement officers, and technical staff committed to implementing ethical AI practices</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oversight Leadership</strong>: Enhanced leadership from Parliament, the Auditor-General, and other oversight institutions in adapting their roles to address AI governance challenges</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghana stands at a pivotal moment in its digital transformation journey. The decisions made today regarding the integration of artificial intelligence into public procurement systems will determine whether these technologies serve to strengthen democratic governance and promote equitable development or whether they become sources of new forms of exclusion, opacity, and institutional mistrust. The framework presented in this document offers a roadmap for ensuring that Ghana&#8217;s AI procurement reforms align with constitutional values, international best practices, and citizen expectations for accountable governance. By embedding ethical principles into AI system design from the outset, Ghana can avoid the costly mistakes experienced by other countries that implemented AI technologies without adequate safeguards and subsequently faced public backlash, legal challenges, and institutional damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, Ghana has the opportunity to demonstrate regional and global leadership in responsible AI governance. By developing comprehensive ethical frameworks, implementing robust oversight mechanisms, and maintaining genuine public accountability, Ghana can serve as a model for other African countries grappling with similar digital transformation challenges. This leadership position would enhance Ghana&#8217;s reputation among international development partners, attract additional investment in digital governance capabilities, and position the country as a hub for responsible AI innovation in West Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The successful implementation of this framework requires sustained political commitment, adequate resource allocation, and genuine partnership between government institutions, civil society organisations, and the private sector. It also requires recognition that AI governance is not a one-time policy exercise but an ongoing process of adaptation, learning, and improvement as technologies evolve and institutional capabilities develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stakes could not be higher. Public procurement systems that allocate billions of cedis annually must serve all Ghanaians fairly and transparently. AI technologies that enhance these systems must be designed and governed to strengthen rather than undermine democratic values and constitutional principles. The framework presented here provides a foundation for achieving these objectives whilst positioning Ghana for continued leadership in the digital age. The time for action is now. As AI technologies become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent, the window for embedding ethical principles into their design and implementation is narrowing. Ghana must seize this moment to ensure that its digital transformation journey leads towards greater prosperity, equity, and democratic accountability for all its citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The future of Ghana&#8217;s democracy and development depends on the choices made today regarding AI governance. This framework provides the roadmap—implementation requires political will, institutional commitment, and citizen engagement. The opportunity is unprecedented; the imperative is urgent; the time is now.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">********</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About Authors</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Emmanuel Norgah Bukari is a Chief Quantity Surveyor/Reg.

Powell seemed assured there isn’t a risk of such a scenario this time around, adding that “the US economy is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was back in the 1970s.”</p>\n<div class=\"graphic\">\n<div class=\"graphic__chart-anchor\" id=\"graphic-cVv9r\"></div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Economists, however, aren’t as convinced that the conflict doesn’t present a major risk to the US economy.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">In fact, JPMorgan economists said in a recent note to clients, “The US and global economies are set to absorb multiple shocks this year.” Chief among those is the potential for a Middle East war, they said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"subheader inline-placeholder subheader vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2\" id=\"one-of-the-worlds-most-important-oil-chokepoints\">‘One of the world’s most important oil chokepoints’</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“One of the most direct impacts on US consumers would be if the Strait of Hormuz was closed, leading to a spike in energy costs as the flow of seaborne oil and gas becomes disrupted,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.

Meanwhile, Iran has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/politics/us-strikes-trump-iran-israel\">repeatedly threatened</a> to shut down the strait as a form of retaliation.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">That could end up proving to be more limited than what the Iranian government has threatened, though, analysts at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said in a recent note.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“Iran’s leadership is unlikely to fully close the Strait of Hormuz for an extended period; as a first recourse, it is more likely that Iran’s naval forces deploy along the Strait and block passage to selected vessels depending on flag and destination.”</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">Even though the US is considered energy independent, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/business/oil-prices-markets-israel-iran-attack-intl-hnk\">gas prices</a> would still “rocket higher,” Knightley.</p>\n<h2 class=\"subheader inline-placeholder subheader vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2\" id=\"the-tariff-shock\">The tariff shock</h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">While tariff-related price hikes that economists widely expect to occur haven’t shown up in the all-encompassing inflation reports the US government publishes, most believe it’s only a matter of time.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">As the economy recovered from the pandemic, inflation accelerated across the globe. Then, while that unfolded, the war between Russia and Ukraine took hold, sending gas prices soaring and pushing inflation even higher.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">That could very well play out again if gas prices shoot higher due to the conflict.</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\">“With tariff-induced price hikes already set to squeeze household spending power, higher gasoline prices would intensify the strain on consumer pockets, risking a more pronounced slowdown in the economy,” Knightley told CNN.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.egyptindependent.com/americas-economy-could-face-a-war-shock/\">America’s economy could face a war shock</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.egyptindependent.com\">Egypt Independent</a>.</p>",

The case, charged with both legal and emotional weight, became a trending topic — not just because of the man involved, but because of what it symbolised: the hope that nobody is above the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But months later, the once-vibrant conversation has been reduced to whispers. Court updates are rare. Media interest has dwindled. And for many Ghanaians who believed this case would set a precedent for fairness and accountability, a new reality is settling in — justice has stalled, and silence has replaced scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Case That Promised to Shake the System</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of this issue is not just Nana Pooley as an individual, but the system he represents — one where wealth, influence, and connections often dictate the pace of justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the initial charges were made public, Ghanaians expected a swift and transparent process. Civil society groups called for due process. Victims and communities demanded closure. But in recent weeks, court dates have been postponed, updates have gone quiet, and those who once shouted “justice!” now ask “what happened?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justice Delayed… But For How Long?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"The silence around Nana Pooley’s case: When justice sleeps, society suffers\" class=\"wp-image-10032783049\" height=\"683\" src=\"http://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B6959871-59A9-4895-A215-A1ED579DD2C2-1024x683.jpeg\" title=\"The silence around Nana Pooley’s case: When justice sleeps, society suffers\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">the judge hammer a judge in court. located on a desk.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ghanaian legal system is no stranger to delays, but this case highlights a deeper problem: selective urgency. While ordinary citizens can be remanded for months over minor offences, high-profile individuals seem to move through a different set of doors — doors padded with legal delays, bureaucratic loopholes, and political silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this justice, or just the illusion of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What message does it send to victims, communities, and the next generation watching?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Power of Public Pressure — and Its Decline</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason the case gained traction early on was because of public pressure. The media was loud. Social voices were powerful. But the longer a case drags, the easier it is to normalise the silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that may be the most dangerous part of all — when justice becomes just another headline, and the public loses interest, the powerful win. They win not just in court, but in perception. And perception, especially in a democracy, is power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Wake-Up Call for Accountability</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nana Pooley case is not over — but it’s dangerously close to being forgotten. As journalists, activists, and citizens, we must keep asking the hard questions:<br />• Why is there no regular public update from the legal authorities?<br />• Why have timelines shifted with little explanation?<br />• Why is there no consistency in how justice is applied?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justice delayed is not just justice denied — it is justice manipulated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final Word:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case is bigger than one man. It is about whether Ghana’s justice system will rise to meet the challenge of fairness — or fall to the weight of silence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country is watching. History is watching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so are we.</p>",

Today marks such a moment. On behalf of the youth of our great nation, I stand here in Akwa Ibom to salute a bold, visionary, and people-driven decision: &#8216;the alignment of His Excellency, Governor Umo Eno, with the transformational leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8221;Let it be clear: this is not about politics for politics’ sake. This is about responsible leadership that prioritizes the prosperity, dignity, and aspirations of the people over narrow interests. Governor Umo Eno’s choice reflects a deep understanding that Akwa Ibom must be at the heart of Nigeria’s renewed journey towards hope, growth, and greatness. It is a courageous move that signals his determination to secure the best future for the state — one that aligns with the positive changes already reshaping our nation.</p>\n<p>&#8216;We extend our heartfelt commendation to the Honourable Commissioner for Youth of Akwa Ibom State for his invaluable role in strengthening this alliance. His direct engagement with young people, his vision, and his hands-on support during Mr. President’s recent visit demonstrate true patriotism and servant leadership.</p>\n<p>&#8221;We urge Governor Umo Eno to stay focused on the path of good governance, to amplify the creativity, resilience, and enterprise of Akwa Ibom youth, and to work with all stakeholders to sustain Mr. President’s transformative vision well beyond 2027.</p>\n<p>&#8221;Words must be matched with action, We therefore call on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, to expedite the Ibom Deep Seaport Project, a transformative initiative with the potential to unlock jobs, drive industrial growth, and fortify our nation’s economic recovery. Akwa Ibom’s future as an industrial and maritime hub must not be delayed.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2025/06/23/remain-focused-on-path-of-good-governance-youth-council-urges-gov-eno/\">Remain focused on path of good governance &#8211; Youth council urges Gov Eno</a></p>",

From transparent licensing rounds to clearer fiscal disclosures, we are seeing improvements in how the sector is managed,” Idudje said.</p>\n<p>Also speaking at the forum, Dr Arisabor Lucky, a petroleum law expert from the same university, said the legal and institutional frameworks of the PIA are being strengthened by the Commission’s “visible commitment to due process and accountability”.</p>\n<p>“The law is only as effective as its enforcers. What we’ve seen from the NUPRC so far, particularly with respect to host community provisions and reporting obligations, is commendable,” he said.</p>\n<p>A representative from the Nigeria Maritime University, Delta State, said sustained stakeholder participation, especially, civil society involvement, is crucial to holding regulators accountable.</p>\n<p>“NUPRC’s openness to civic participation and data sharing represents a major departure from the past. We urge the Commission to keep that door open,” he said.</p>\n<p>Mallam Nasir Abdulquadri, Project Manager at Shafana Enterprises, said the purpose of the forum was to evaluate how far institutions like the NUPRC have gone in delivering on the objectives of the PIA.</p>\n<p>He said the Commission’s role in anchoring the Tinubu administration’s Renewed Hope agenda in the petroleum sector was evident through systematic reforms and enforcement of compliance measures.</p>\n<p>“The PIA is one of the most consequential legislative interventions in Nigeria’s oil and gas history. What we need now is consistency and openness. NUPRC, under Komolafe, is showing that commitment,” Abdulquadri said.</p>\n<p>He added that stronger monitoring, improved community feedback, and inter-agency collaboration would consolidate the early gains.</p>\n<p>Traditional rulers at the forum also praised the Commission’s outreach efforts. Chief Ekeme Otuedon, a monarch from Delta State, said the Commission’s engagement with host communities has helped ease longstanding tensions.</p>\n<p>“We have seen more consultation, more visits, and better communication from the regulator in the past year. That makes a difference in how communities respond to government presence,” he said.</p>\n<p>A student representative from the Delta State University, Fejiro Oghenegivwe, said transparency and openness in the petroleum sector governance matter to young professionals.</p>\n<p>“As future engineers and scientists, we are inspired by how regulatory standards are being strengthened. It gives us hope that merit and accountability are possible in this industry,” she said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2025/06/23/transparency-in-pia-can-unlock-investment-in-oil-sector-stakeholders-assess-nuprc/\">Transparency in PIA can unlock investment in oil sector &#8211; Stakeholders assess NUPRC</a></p>",

Applicants were then unexpectedly informed last week that the entire call had been cancelled without explanation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Sources in Morocco <a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/world-news/middle-east/article/18220649\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> that the targeted projects had no connection to Israel. “The projects had no link to the Israeli genocide in Gaza, Zionism or political events, but were solely focused on preserving Moroccan Jewish culture,” they told Israel Hayom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">The cancelled initiatives included preservation of centuries-old cemeteries, cultural programming, history education, and studies of pre-state Jewish-Muslim shared <a href=\"https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2025/06/207150/proposal-to-rename-agadir-streets-after-jewish-figures-sparks-debate/\" target=\"_blank\">heritage</a> in Morocco.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Those familiar with the matter suggested political motivations behind the decision. “The timing of the cancellation is not neutral. It followed the military escalation and the shift in European positions toward Israel and the Palestinians. The message is clear: Jewish equals political, and political equals ‘unacceptable,’” they stated, according to the Hebrew report.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Community leaders in Morocco accused the EU of reducing Moroccan Jewish identity to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. They characterized this as stemming from “historical ignorance and racism.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">“This punishes communities for a geopolitical reality they neither created nor control. It’s not policy—it’s fallout. And it comes at the expense of cultural preservation, truth, and justice,” the sources added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">According to the French-language rejection letter obtained by Israel Hayom, applicants were simply told: “Monsieur, thank you for submitting a full application to the above call. It is with great regret that I inform you that the call has been cancelled. I invite you to consult future calls for proposals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">The cancellation impacts preservation <a href=\"https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2025/03/178160/three-jewish-monuments-in-assilah-added-to-national-heritage/\" target=\"_blank\">efforts</a> for a Jewish presence in Morocco that spans over 2,300 years. This heritage was shaped through multiple historical phases, including migrations following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and the influx of Jewish exiles from Spain in 1492.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">Under Islamic rule, Moroccan Jews lived as dhimmis with internal autonomy while serving as diplomats, merchants, and advisors during the Saadi and Alaouite dynasties, creating a unique cultural identity distinct from both European and Middle Eastern Jewish communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;\">By 1956, Morocco’s Jewish <a href=\"https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/10/13684/controversial-petition-for-moroccan-citizenship-to-jewish-descendants-sparks-debate/\" target=\"_blank\">population</a> had grown to approximately 250,000, making it one of the largest Jewish communities in the Arab world.

In this era, ethical journalism is not just important, it is essential&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He revealed plans by the Federal Government, in partnership with UNESCO, to establish a world-first Category-2 Media and Information Literacy Institute in Abuja, which is projected to be a landmark initiative aimed at promoting media responsibility and literacy in the digital age.</p>\n<p>Idris noted that when fully operational, the Institute will serve as a transformative hub for building ethical journalism and informed citizenship in Nigeria&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The Minister informed participants of government’s willingness to partner with the NUJ on matters of journalists’ welfare, digitisation, gender inclusion, and institutional support.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, elder statesman and veteran journalist, Chief Olusegun Osoba, urged the Federal Government and NUJ leadership to take proactive steps in tackling the menace of fake journalism in Nigeria.</p>\n<p>Osoba cautioned that the credibility and future of the profession are at risk, especially if impostors continue to undermine professional standards.</p>\n<p>He noted that NUJ remains the mother body describing other affiliates of NUJ as “club” .</p>\n<p>Citing his own transition from analog to digital journalism, Osoba urged practitioners to embrace innovation. “I was once an analog journalist, but today I can proudly tell you that I am a digital reporter. Change is inevitable. Journalists must adapt to survive.”</p>\n<p>He encouraged the media to stand firm against misinformation, uphold truth and public accountability, and honour the legacy of fallen heroes of the press. “Our profession is under siege from partisan interference and the erosion of ethical values. But we must continue to stand firm on the side of fairness and public interest.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the NUJ President Comrade Alhassan Yahaya described the Union’s 70-year journey as a testament to professionalism, patriotism, and the power of journalism to shape national development.</p>\n<p>“Our 70th anniversary is more than just a commemoration of our past,” he said. “It is a rallying cry for the future we envision a future rooted in ethical journalism, responsible innovation, and unrelenting advocacy for press freedom.”</p>\n<p>He recalled how the Union, founded on March 15, 1955, began as a platform to advocate for journalists’ welfare but evolved into a powerful institution at the forefront of national discourse and democracy.</p>\n<p>Abdullahi described the NUJ&#8217;s Platinum Jubilee as a historic moment of celebration, reflection, and renewed commitment to defending the role of journalism in Nigeria’s democratic journey.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2025/06/23/nuj-70-tinubu-underscores-media-influence-in-actualising-june-12-struggles/\">NUJ @70: Tinubu underscores media influence in actualising June 12 struggles</a></p>",

It urged the President to ensure justice for the victims by identifying and prosecuting the perpetrators of the violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group further lamented what it perceived as indifference from some influential figures in Northern Nigeria. While avoiding direct accusations, SNM noted that the silence of certain groups and elders in the region could be interpreted as tacit approval of the violence, urging them to speak out and support national unity and justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The world watched how northern groups responded swiftly to incidents involving northerners elsewhere. The same concern must be shown for the lives of all Nigerians, regardless of ethnicity or location,” the statement said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reiterating its support for Governor Hyacinth Alia’s call for state police, SNM described the initiative as a “viable long-term solution” to address the worsening security crisis in Benue and other vulnerable states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group also addressed the issue of land use and grazing policies, calling for reforms that promote ranching over open grazing. It cautioned against any arrangement that could be perceived as favoring one group’s economic interest at the expense of local communities, especially those still reeling from the effects of violent displacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While acknowledging calls from some quarters for self-defense, the group advised caution, warning that unmanaged community defense efforts could lead to further instability. It instead emphasized the need for state-controlled security frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SNM concluded by urging Benue residents to support genuine government interventions and rebuild trust in democratic processes, stressing that communal resilience and federal leadership must go hand in hand to confront the existential threat facing the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If our people lose faith in both state and federal efforts, the crisis may spiral beyond control. It is time to unite, take responsibility, and demand lasting solutions,” the statement added.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/06/benue-killings-group-urges-tinubu-to-take-decisive-action-supports-state-police/\">Benue Killings: Group urges Tinubu to take decisive action, supports State Police</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>",

      "description": "After more than seven months of blocking new users, Starlink is taking fresh sign-ups in Nairobi and other parts of Kenya.",
      "content": "<p>After more than seven months of <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/05/21/starlink-overcapacity-nairobi-kenya/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocking new users,</a> Starlink is taking fresh sign-ups in Nairobi and other parts of Kenya. Its coverage map now shows availability in key towns, and at least three users told TechCabal they’ve managed to activate their kits this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It can be installed anywhere in Kenya right now,” said Isaac Migiro, a customer in Nairobi who purchased a kit in December and activated it this June. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A retailer who sells Starlink kits told TechCabal on Monday, June 23, that “Starlink is now back to full capacity.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The freeze, which began in late 2024 and affected Nairobi and other areas, including Kiambu, Machakos, Kajiado, and Murang’a, resulted from  a surge in demand that stretched Starlink’s network past its limits. Too many users in one area meant slower speeds, lags, and an eventual halt on new activations.<a href=\"https://techwithmuchiri.com/starlink-ground-station-in-nairobi-kenya/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> A new ground station </a>in Nairobi, launched in January, was meant to ease the pressure, but demand in urban areas is still pushing the network to its limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Starlink’s rapid growth, driven by word of mouth, media attention, and social posts from Elon Musk, has run into regulatory pushback. In Kenya, the government wants to<a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/01/24/starlink-largest-isp-kenya/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> raise satellite licence fees f</a>rom $12,302 to $115,331 and introduce a 0.4% turnover levy, a move that would hit smaller satellite internet service providers (ISPs) hardest and give an edge to bigger players. Elsewhere, in countries like <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/06/05/starlink-cut-off-south-africa/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">South Africa</a> and Zimbabwe, Starlink is facing resistance for operating without full local approvals or through unofficial resellers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"list-newsletter-form shortcode\" id=\"list-newsletter-form\">\n    <h2>Get the best

and where Starlink is the only real option for fast internet. Even with steep costs of KES 30,000 ($232) for hardware and KES 6,500 ($50) monthly, it’s become essential for homes, schools, and small businesses outside city centres.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But local rivals aren’t sitting back. Safaricom is <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/04/18/safaricom-5g-router-versus-starlink-push-rural-kenya/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pushing cheaper 5G routers</a>, with devices priced at KES 3,000 ($23) and monthly plans starting at KES 4,000 ($31), less than half of what Starlink charges. These plans target customers in urban and peri-urban areas with decent mobile coverage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/05/05/airtel-africa-partners-spacex-to-expand-starlink/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Airtel has teamed up with Starlink</a> to use its satellite backhaul for rural expansion. Safaricom has also<a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/05/09/safaricom-explores-satellite-play-starlink/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> hinted at exploring satellite partnerships of its own,</a> indicating that the market is shifting towards hybrid models that combine fibre, mobile, and satellite connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of 2024, Starlink had over 19,000 active users in Kenya, making it the seventh-largest ISP. But it still has no local office and handles everything online, a setup that frustrates customers dealing with delays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mark your calendars!  Moonshot by TechCabal is back in Lagos on October 15–16!

      "content": "<p><strong>Zimpapers Sports Hub</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>THERE has been deafening silence from Dynamos management following their abandoned match against FC Platinum at Mandava on Sunday.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The PSL giants walked off the pitch in protest after FC Platinum were awarded a second half penalty with the scores tied at 1-1.</p>\n<p>The match could not continue, and referee Quedsani Dirwai was forced to end the game prematurely.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After that incident, Dynamos appear set to forfeit the three points and are likely to be slapped with a fine of around US$3,000.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This development only adds to the Harare giants’ mounting challenges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Aside from a battered image, this is a club that recently admitted to financial difficulties, is at loggerheads with sections of its supporters who are boycotting home matches, and is also flirting with relegation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For many, the Dynamos executive or board, led by Bernard Marriot, should have released a press statement outlining the club’s official position following Sunday’s incident, which has both short- and long-term implications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But nothing has come. Just silence, as the debate rages on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Only head coach Saul Chaminuka’s post match remarks justifying their actions remain the club’s official position.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While several critics have argued that the penalty awarded to FC Platinum may not have been the best decision by the referee, they also agree that walking off the pitch was a distasteful and damaging reaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FC Platinum coach Norman Mapeza distanced himself from his counterparts’ response.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We cannot solve the problem if you are going to walk out of the pitch. We cannot solve anything. It has happened to us, and I’m not saying it has happened to Dynamos, so it’s okay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We’ve had goals scored from offside positions… We’ve been denied penalties. But you can’t walk off the pitch. You just can’t,” said Mapeza.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Let’s just continue playing, you never know what might happen. I don’t think this is good for our football at the moment.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Responding during a post-match interview, Chaminuka countered Mapeza’s remarks by referencing another incident in the same game, suggesting FC Platinum should have been reduced to 10 men.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“What is he (Mapeza) saying about that? I’m looking at him as a father, just like me. Was that a yellow card, when you deliberately attack someone after the whistle has gone? That was a red card offence… The game continued until we then said, ‘I think this is enough,’” said Chaminuka.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.heraldonline.co.zw/is-dynamos-on-auto-pilot-2/\">Is Dynamos on auto-pilot?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.heraldonline.co.zw\">herald</a>.</p>",

Ademola Adeleke of Osun says he will pursue legal means as a form of peaceful resolution to the ongoing local government crisis in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is contained in a statement made available to newsmen on Monday in Osogbo by Malam Olawale Rasheed, the spokesperson for the governor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adeleke, however, hailed the judgement delivered by the Court of Appeal, Akure Division, which he said reaffirmed the legality of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) local government chairmen and councillors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the governor, the latest judgement by the court has put an end to lies about the reinstatement of the All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmen and councillors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The APC chairmen councillors were sacked by the court, which has affirmed the legitimacy of the PDP chairmen and councillors. Unlike the opposition, we are people of due process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The latest judgement is being served on all relevant stakeholders at the state and national level. Our expectation is a quick restoration of normalcy in line with the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I appreciate the deep love for peace and unity as demonstrated by the PDP chairmen and councillors of the 30 local governments and area councils since their swearing in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Your patience and support for the law have paid off,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The governor commended security agencies for their commitment to law, as well as peace and tranquillity in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adeleke also commended residents in the state for their patience and commitment and urged them to remain peaceful in their conduct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Evil plots against our dear state on all fronts have been foiled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We must continue to remain peaceful and never allow agents of violence and enemies of the people to drag the state into violence and backwardness,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that on June 13, the Court of Appeal, Akure Division, dismissed an application by the APC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application sought to relist an earlier appeal that was struck out on Jan. 13 for lack of diligent prosecution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state government said that the Court of Appeal ruling affirmed the Federal High Court judgement that sacked the council chairmen and councillors elected in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, APC maintained that the ruling did not nullify the election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case originated from a suit filed by the All Peoples Party (APP) against Osun State Independent Electoral Commission (OSSIEC) at the Federal High Court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The suit challenged the legality of the Oct. 15, 2022, local government election, which featured only APC candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>APC, which later joined the matter at the Federal High Court, appealed the judgement after the lower court nullified the election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the appeal was struck out on Jan. 13 due to lack of diligent prosecution by the APC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>APC’s attempt to have the case relisted was also dismissed by the Court of Appeal on June 13.

      "description": "IXPN has led efforts to localise the country’s internet traffic, and is currently aiming to keep 80% of Nigeria’s internet traffic within national borders by 2030.",
      "content": "<p>In 2006, a request from a computer in Lagos to another computer in Abuja took a bizarre and expensive detour to the US or even the UK. Nigerian data didn’t stay in Nigeria; in fact, only 0.01% of Nigeria’s internet traffic remained within its borders. The result was slower load times, higher costs, and a fragile digital infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the problem the Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria (IXPN) has been trying to solve for nearly two decades, and it’s working. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>IXPN, the operator of Nigeria’s first carrier-neutral data centre, has led efforts to localise the country’s internet traffic, and is currently aiming to keep 80% of Nigeria’s internet traffic within national borders by 2030.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When we started, just 0.01% of traffic was local,” said Muhammad Rudman, Chief Executive Officer of IXPN, during a peering community meeting hosted by Equinix on June 20, 2025. “Now, based on a survey with our members, between 40% and 70% of internet traffic is staying within Nigeria.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IXPN handled just 800 kilobits per second of traffic in 2006, barely enough to load a modern homepage. Today, it <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/04/22/facebook-tiktok-drive-nigerias-record-internet-traffic/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">moves over 1 terabit per second</a>. The exchange point now plans to double its current capacity by the end of 2025, driven by confidence in Nigeria’s accelerating digital transformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IXPN’s foundation was laid with seed funding from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), with a core mission to build trust and reduce Nigeria’s reliance on foreign internet pathways. The funding enabled the establishment of Nigeria’s first carrier-neutral data centre. This open, non-discriminatory interconnection facility helped dismantle monopolies and allowed smaller internet service providers (ISPs) to connect and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the path to progress wasn’t without challenges. In the early days, most Nigerian ISPs relied on costly satellite links or international transit providers. Local peering required technical expertise, a new business mindset, and—most importantly—trust, all of which were initially in short supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pivotal moment came when Google began peering with IXPN. This endorsement sparked confidence among local ISPs, particularly access and content providers, leading to a surge in local connections and traffic volume. It marked the beginning of a more self-sufficient internet ecosystem in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Routing internet traffic through international channels before it returns to Nigerian users not only causes delays but also increases costs and heightens exposure to global security threats. IXPN’s strategy of keeping traffic within the country ensures faster load times, reduces latency, and strengthens national cybersecurity. As Rudman noted, accessing a Nigerian website shouldn&#8217;t require a detour through Europe or the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond just traffic volumes, IXPN is focused on building robust foundational infrastructure. It now hosts multiple critical <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">DNS root servers</a>, including those for .com, .net, .ng, and recently, .ca domains, ensuring that domain name resolutions are handled locally. This development improves browsing speeds and enhances resilience during global network outages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are working to bring all critical internet infrastructure into Nigeria,” Rudman said. “For example, we’ve partnered with VeriSign to host their root servers for .com and .net here at IXPN.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to technical growth, IXPN has taken a collaborative approach with the ecosystem. Notably, the organisation has never disconnected any ISP over non-payment, choosing instead to prioritise inclusive development over commercial gain.</p>",

      "description": "Chowdeck acquires POS startup Mira to deepen restaurant integration, expand revenue streams, and extend its reach beyond delivery in Africa's challenging logistics market.",
      "content": "<p>YC-backed Chowdeck, a Nigeria-born on-demand delivery platform, has acquired Mira, a point of sale (POS) founded in 2023 by Flutterwave alumnus Ted Oladele and Paystack’s Olaseike Ibojo. The deal adds Mira’s inventory management, payment processing, and inventory financing tools to Chowdeck’s delivery ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of the acquisition is undisclosed. However, this positions Chowdeck to integrate Mira’s POS suite—including hardware, inventory management, and invoicing—with its 10,000-strong delivery fleet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mira CEO Oladele will join Chowdeck as Head of Product, with some Mira employees to scale the new business segment. Ibojo will be going on a career break after spending most of the last decade at Paystack and working on Mira since its founding in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes on the tail of Chowdeck’s international expansion. The three-year-old startup, which grew from 300 users in October 2021 to <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/02/11/chowdeck-chooses-ghana-for-international-debut/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1 million monthly users</a> by October 2024, recently expanded to Accra. The company reports that it is on track to complete 1,000 deliveries in Accra within two months,&nbsp; a milestone that reportedly took a year to reach in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mira acquisition will deepen the startup’s relationship with vendors in new and existing markets. “For a long time, we’ve focused more on the customer side than on the restaurant, supermarket, and pharmacy side,” Femi Aluko, Chowdeck’s CEO,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://techpoint.africa/news/chowdeck-acquires-mira/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Zoho+Social\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. “But as we begin to expand, we’re paying deeper attention to the vendor side.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why the acquisition matters</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Few sectors in Nigeria are as unforgiving as last-mile logistics. Poor infrastructure, thin margins, and price-sensitive customers keep margins thin, forcing even deep-pocketed entrants like Jumia Food and Bolt Food to abandon the market since 2022. The courier-logistics sector has seen venture capital-funded players like Sendstack, Sendy, Hytch, and others pivot or exit the market for the same reason. Investor interest in the sector—namely, last-mile logistics and food delivery—has also continued to decline.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acquiring <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2024/09/02/mira-recipe-for-differentiation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mira enables Chowdeck to embed itself deeper</a> into merchant operations, moving beyond delivery alone to provide in-store capabilities such as real-time inventory management, a point-of-sale (POS) suite, and integrated payment solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div

infrastructure provider, driving back-of-house and front-of-house operations. Becoming central to restaurant operations makes Chowdeck&#8217;s network far more defensible, as it becomes indispensable to its partners and less vulnerable to the price wars or poaching tactics of rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Chowdeck’s revenue was primarily generated from delivery commissions and service fees. The integration opens up new income sources, allowing Chowdeck to earn fees from in-store transactions, payment processing, and value-added services such as financing for vendors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy mirrors playbooks that have been successful globally. For instance, DoorDash’s acquisition of Bbot enabled it to serve both delivery and in-store customers through unified payment and ordering systems, thereby increasing merchant stickiness. Similarly, Square’s expansion from payments into e-commerce and buy-now-pay-later services created a seamless merchant experience across all channels. These moves have consistently resulted in deeper customer loyalty and improved margins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Nigeria, PiggyVest acquired a restaurant aggregator startup in an attempt to secure payments from food businesses. More recently, Glovo, one of Chowdeck’s leading competitors, partnered with Salad Africa to launch a financing program for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) operating on the Glovo platform in Nigeria. This program provides eligible Glovo partners with access to working capital loans ranging from ₦50,000 to ₦100 million, aiming to support their growth and expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mira’s visibility into in-store data strengthens Chowdeck’s moat</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chowdeck&#8217;s acquisition of Mira and its POS capabilities directly addresses a critical pain point for food delivery platforms, significantly enhancing the user experience. A common frustration for customers is ordering an out-of-stock item, which can lead to delays or cancellations. There is often a disconnect between the inventory on the several food delivery apps these businesses use and the inventory as it exists in their walk-in stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Osarumen Osamuyi, Founder of Subtext, a publication that has published studies on food delivery emphasises the systemic difficulty of resolving this issue, noting, &#8220;The challenge is that it&#8217;s difficult to solve this problem without having a monopoly on the market because the restaurants need to be able to sell on multiple aggregators.&#8221; Osamuyi noted that these platforms have deployed human agents in high-traffic restaurants to address this issue. &#8220;However, being integrated with the inventory management system is a much more elegant way of doing that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mira&#8217;s integration allows Chowdeck to mitigate these issues by presenting accurate, up-to-the-minute inventory information. This could translate to fewer cancelled orders, faster delivery times, and an overall smoother ordering experience. Ultimately, by eliminating guesswork and improving order fulfilment reliability, Chowdeck fosters greater trust and satisfaction among users, leading to increased loyalty and stickiness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond improving the ordering experience, the real-time data from Mira&#8217;s integration creates significant opportunities for Chowdeck to support its merchant partners with financing and operational improvements. Deeper insights into a restaurant&#8217;s in-store sales and inventory movements enable Chowdeck to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its financial health and operational needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mira acquisition broadens Chowdeck&#8217;s scope from logistics into the competitive fintech sector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To scale its POS business, Chowdeck will face deep-pocketed competition such as Moniepoint, a unicorn in the fintech space, which <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/01/31/moniepoint-jack-dorseys-square-with-new-pos/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently acquired a POS startup</a> to target some of the retail customers Chowdeck is now pursuing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samuel Frank, an analyst at VC firm Sahara Impact Ventures, notes that acquisitions could lead to a larger team and, consequently, higher staff-related expenses. Mira CEO, Oladele, is joining Chowdeck; it remains unclear how many other Mira team members will transition to Chowdeck or what new hires the merged entity has made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div

holds&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the retreat of big players like Jumia Food, BoltFood, and others, Nigeria’s food delivery and logistics sector is experiencing rapid growth. Rapid urbanisation and consumers’ growing appetite for convenience are fuelling the growth of Nigeria’s food-delivery and logistics markets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/emo/online-food-delivery/africa#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Food,US%2423.46bn%20by%202030.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">project</a> that the sector’s value will reach $14.41 billion by the end of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This intense competition compels key players to find unique ways to stand out. Platforms primarily differentiate themselves through their efforts to achieve faster delivery times, secure exclusive restaurant collaborations, such as Chowdeck&#8217;s partnership <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2023/08/04/chowdeck-announces-chicken-republics-integration-into-its-ecosystem-as-a-new-restaurant-partner/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">with Chicken Republic in 2024</a>, offer loyalty programmes with subscription-based discounts, and, more recently, integrate advanced technologies like AI for personalised recommendations and route optimisation. The competitive environment is further shaped by the rise of cloud kitchens and virtual restaurants, which enable lower overheads and a wider variety of menus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the strong growth, the sector continues to face persistent operational hurdles. Significant traffic congestion and unreliable power supplies impact delivery times and operational efficiency. Furthermore, high operation costs and rising inflation remain barriers to broader consumer adoption, while logistical inefficiencies, especially in last-mile delivery, demand ongoing innovation and investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, leading platforms continue to adapt their strategies to maintain a competitive edge and gain more market share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the acquisition of Mira, Chowdeck is constructing an unparalleled moat. It’s a bold bet that could fundamentally reshape the company’s economics, create a defensible business model beyond mere price competition. If the integration is successful, the company could escape razor-thin margins and emerge as the blueprint for food delivery in Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There just might be a defensible path to success in Africa&#8217;s food delivery landscape, which has been heavily criticised as an unwinnable race to the bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mark your calendars!&nbsp; Moonshot by TechCabal is back in Lagos on October 15–16!

      "content": "<p>Egypt on Monday condemned a terrorist bombing that targeted St. Elias Church in Damascus, an attack which Syrian authorities said killed 22 people and injured 59 others.</p>\n<p>In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry extended its sincere condolences to the Syrian people and the victims&#8217; families, and wished the injured a speedy recovery. The government reaffirmed its unwavering position against all forms of violence, extremism, and terrorism.</p>\n<p>The statement also reiterated the importance of uniting regional and international efforts to eliminate terrorism, eradicate its sources, and confront criminal acts that seek to undermine security and stability.</p>\n<p>Syrian officials have announced that their preliminary investigation indicates the involvement of the ISIS organisation.</p>\n<p>According to Syrian Ministry of Interior Spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba, the perpetrator was a suicide bomber. Speaking at a press conference, he stated that the attacker entered the church, opened fire, and then detonated his explosives.</p>\n<p>Al-Baba added that &#8220;the attack did not target a specific sect, but all Syrians,&#8221; noting that the operation was intended to incite sectarian strife and destabilise the country. He emphasised that the security of places of worship is a &#8220;red line&#8221; and that all those involved in this act will be held accountable.</p>\n<p>The Syrian Ministry of Health confirmed the casualty figures from the attack, which occurred in the capital&#8217;s Duwaila’a district. In a statement broadcast by Syria TV, the ministry noted that the injured had been transported to hospitals to receive necessary medical care and that their conditions were being continuously and directly monitored.</p>\n<p>Following the explosion, Internal Security Forces established a tight security cordon around the church. The measures included closing all roads leading to the site, as well as shuttering other churches in the nearby neighbourhoods of Bab Touma, Bab Sharqi, al-Qassaa, and Duwaila&#8217;a as a precaution against potential future attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/23/egypt-condemns-deadly-damascus-church-terrorist-bombing-that-killed-22/\">Egypt condemns deadly Damascus church terrorist bombing that Killed 22</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com\">Dailynewsegypt</a>.</p>",

      "description": "Equinix hosted its first community meeting with key players in Nigeria’s digital network and infrastructure ecosystem. More than a meet-and-greet, the event was an occasion for strategic positioning.",
      "content": "<p>On June 20, 2025—eight months <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2024/10/22/equinix-finalizes-mainone-integration/\">after completing its $320 million acquisition</a> and integration of MainOne, Nigeria’s pioneering private submarine cable operator—Equinix hosted its first community meeting with key players in Nigeria’s digital network and infrastructure ecosystem. More than a meet-and-greet, the event was an occasion for the company to make known its post-acquisition play in Africa. “We’re not here to compete; we want to be an enabler in the market,”&nbsp;said Brenden Rawle, Equinix’s Senior Director of Business Development for EMEA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wole Abu, Equinix’s Managing Director for West Africa, echoed the message, emphasising the company’s intention to expand opportunities for everyone. “We create a platform for everyone to thrive. So while we have local routes, we now have global connections,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over 260 International Business Exchanges (IBX) under management, Equinix operates some of the most critical global digital infrastructure, offering data centre colocation, interconnection, cloud on-ramps, and internet exchange points. These services sit at the core of modern telecom and internet operations, enabling operators, cloud providers, content platforms, and enterprise clients to connect and scale seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a market like Nigeria, where low-latency, high-reliability infrastructure and data sovereignty are growing concerns, Equinix’s presence could easily be seen as a competitive force. Yet, by maintaining a carrier-neutral stance and supporting rather than displacing local networks, the company is positioning itself not as a rival but as a backbone to facilitate the growth and efficiency of the entire telecom and digital ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central to this carrier-neutral positioning is Equinix Fabric—a software that allows businesses to connect their digital infrastructure, such as data centres, clouds, networks, and partners, directly and on-demand through Equinix’s global network. Operators, fintechs, cloud-native startups, and enterprise businesses can bypass traditional internet routing and establish direct, secure connections, helping reduce latency and improve reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Equinix Fabric is one of my favorite tools. It inspires innovation. You start thinking of new services to offer the moment you plug in,” said Oluwasayo Oshadami, Director, Solutions Architects, Equinix. “You spin up connections when you need them, spin them down when you don’t. It’s efficient, cost-effective, and global.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equinix Fabric went live in South Africa in May 2025, marking its first deployment on the African continent. It is scheduled to launch in Lagos in H1 2026, expanding access to a global digital fabric currently active in 63 metropolitan locations worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking during the meeting, Rawle said of the&nbsp; company’s philosophy that “success means building a platform that welcomes everyone: providers, networks, fintechs, enterprises.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equinix’s global strategy hinges on a dual approach: maintaining strong local relevance while leveraging a powerful international platform. &#8220;We are a global company, but we must act locally. The access to local consumers and enterprises is what draws the big global players to our ecosystem,&#8221; Rawle said. That thinking informed Equinix’s decision to acquire MainOne—a move that brought credibility, local insight, and operational continuity into its Nigerian and West African expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Nigeria, Equinix operates in three other African countries: South Africa, Ghana, and Côte d’Ivoire. Its total investment on the continent has surpassed half a billion dollars, covering acquisition, integration, and infrastructure upgrades. In Nigeria alone, significant post-acquisition capital has been deployed to upgrade existing MainOne facilities and to build out new capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’ve already invested more on top of the $320 million acquisition to upgrade and expand,&#8221; Rawle said. &#8220;Our roadmap includes new facilities—LG3, LG4, and LG5—as well as additional interconnection services. LG3 is 25 kilometres from the current campus, and LG4, launching in 2027, will be even larger.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bridging infrastructure and policy gaps</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The stakes are high. West Africa is one of the world’s youngest, fastest-growing, and most mobile-first populations. Equinix sees this demographic as central to an upcoming explosion in digital traffic. &#8220;When we looked at West Africa, we saw a market defined by tech-savvy youth, entrepreneurship, and digital ambition. But we knew the best way to enter was through partnership or acquisition. The MainOne deal gave us that local depth and credibility,&#8221; Rawle explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But expansion is not without hurdles. Reliable access to power, favourable regulation, and clear digital infrastructure policies remain uneven across the region. Equinix is engaging governments and policymakers to bridge knowledge gaps, especially around AI and the infrastructure demands of emerging technologies. “Many governments want to be AI hubs, but they underestimate the infrastructure it requires. We help them understand what’s needed—particularly power capacity,” Rawle noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equinix’s platform boasts more than 4,000 customers globally and over 64,000 interconnections. In Nigeria, the company is betting on partnership, not disruption, to expand its reach and impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mark your calendars!&nbsp; Moonshot by TechCabal is back in Lagos on October 15–16!

      "title": "Can the UN forge a new development doctrine in Seville?",
      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>Ten years ago delegates from all over the world gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to discuss the future of development finance. African countries saw grounds for cautious optimism. Foreign investment flows to the continent had doubled over the preceding decade. New sources of credit - especially dollar-denominated bonds and Chinese loans - created financing options beyond traditional aid. An ambitious list of \"Sustainable Development Goals\" (SDGs) was being finalised. The World Bank talked of turning \"billions to trillions\" by courting the pension funds and insurers of rich nations.</p><p>But the last decade has not turned out as promised. Growth in Africa has slowed, from an annual average of 5% in the ten years before the third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July 2015, to 3% since. The next of these United Nations conferences is on 30 June in the Spanish city of Seville.</p><p>The UN thinks that another $4 trillion is needed every year to achieve the SDG targets, but money is hard to come by: the US is cantankerous; China preoccupied; investors hesitant; taxpayers indignant; and budgets stretched. Four days of talking in Seville will not change any of that. But the conference, the fourth in a series since 2002, is a forum where countries meet on a slightly more equal footing than usual. For African countries, it might be an opportunity to articulate an alternative vision of how to finance development - if anyone is listening.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A lost decade</h2><p>In retrospect the Addis Ababa conference of 2015 was a high-water mark, held at the very moment the tide was about to turn. The miracle of Chinese growth and the convulsions of western finance had, for a time, worked in Africa's favour: low interest rates, quantitative easing and soaring commodity prices all brought capital to the continent.</p><p>But however carefully they managed their economies, and however vital their natural resources, African countries were still on the periphery of the world economy, buffeted by forces beyond their control.</p><p>The first shock was a slump in commodity markets in 2014. Already China's economy was slowing, and soon American interest rates began to rise. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Those big shocks - Covid, climate change, the different wars that are happening globally - have really diverted so much of the resources that were meant for development,\" says Claver Gatete, the executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).</p><p>Foreign financiers proved to be fair weather friends. Bond yields spiked when the pandemic hit, shutting African governments out of international capital markets for nearly two years. Since 2020 they have been paying back more money to banks and bondholders than they have received in new credit. Lending from China also dried up: its loans to Africa peaked at $29bn in 2016 before falling to $1bn in 2022; they totalled less than $5bn in 2023, according to researchers at Boston University. Aid from traditional donors has fallen too, even before the latest cuts.</p><p>As for the vaunted plan to turn \"billions to trillions\", even the World Bank's president Ajay Banga now concedes that it was \"unrealistic\". By their own reckoning, multilateral development banks and development finance institutions mobilised about $20bn of private co-financing for their projects in Africa in 2023, with only modest increases over the last decade. Less foreign direct investment is flowing into Africa now than in 2015.</p><p>A recent report from an International Commission of Experts on Financing for Development, reflecting on the legacy of the Addis Ababa conference, reaches sobering conclusions. \"Ten years on,\" it says, \"the record of achievement falls far short of what was envisioned... The SDGs, as an international framework for action, have been systematically undermined. The international financial system has proved to be ill-suited to support the investment needed and drive transformative change.\"</p><p>Léonce Ndikumana, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who sat on the expert commission, describes a sense of déjà vu. \"It's as if 2015 is today,\" he says. \"The same issues are being raised, and the same dissatisfaction is still being expressed, and the same gaps are still being observed.\"</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Taxing times</h2><p>What is to be done? For all the talk of new financing mechanisms, the most important source of money is still taxation, which raises twice as much revenue as inflows of aid, remittances and foreign investment combined. African states collect about as much tax as might be expected, given their levels of income, but are struggling to get more. In 2015 they raised an average of 14.1% of GDP in taxes, according to the OECD - the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a club of rich countries. By 2022 the figure had crept up to 14.6%.</p><p>Lots of effort has gone into collecting taxes from small informal businesses, without much success. Many of these businesses make miniscule profits anyway. In countries like Uganda and Tanzania, disgruntled traders have shuttered their shops for days in protest. In Kenya, protesters tried to storm parliament last year and forced the president William Ruto to back down on his revenue-raising plans, such as a value-added tax on bread.</p><p>A more promising source of revenue, for some countries at least, is natural resources. \"African countries are made to believe that they must provide good incentives in the form of tax reductions and waivers for foreign companies to come and invest in extractive industries,\" says Ndikumana, \"and they end up getting very little from the exploitation of natural resources in terms of tax revenue\".</p><p>He argues that governments should play a more direct role in extraction and negotiate for a larger share of the profits in joint ventures, as Botswana has recently done with the mining company De Beers.</p><p>\"The other problem,\" says Ndikumana, \"is that multinational corporations are very, very good at evading taxes, by manipulating their profits, by shifting their revenue to low-tax jurisdictions outside the continent, and by gaming the system through things like transfer pricing.\"</p><p>African countries have been leading the charge for a UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, hoping that they will have more of a say at the UN than in existing processes led by the OECD. Negotiations on the text began in February, although the US immediately walked out.</p><p>Clamping down on tax avoidance is part of a broader effort to stem illicit financial flows. Ndikumana and his colleague James Boyce have scrutinised discrepancies in the capital accounts of 30 African countries and estimate that $97bn has fled the continent unrecorded every year on average since 2010.</p><p>That is an estimate of capital flight, not uncollected tax, and the estimates are contested: discrepancies in the data sometimes have innocent explanations. Nonetheless, the problem is probably large, and too often overlooked.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking outside</h2><p>Meanwhile, the world's richest countries have failed to meet their promises to provide 0.7% of their income in aid, while continuing to gobble resources, harbour illicit outflows, and fuel climate change. Most big bilateral donors will spend less on aid this year than last, according to SEEK Development, a consultancy.</p><p>Donald Trump's budget proposals would cut the US foreign aid budget to just 0.03% of its GDP, according to DEVEX. \"There has to be an increase in terms of concessional resources,\" says Gatete of UNECA. \"We are not talking about aid; we are talking about cheap resources for developing countries.\"</p><p>He argues for a scale-up of financing through the concessional lending arms of the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB), both of which provide long-term loans at interest rates far better than those on offer from private creditors.</p><p>An independent expert group on the reform of multilateral development banks, commissioned by the Indian presidency of the G20 group of nations, reckons they could be lending an additional $260bn a year by 2030, including $60bn of extra concessional finance; but that will only happen if rich countries stump up more money.</p><p>The World Bank's concessional lending arm has a record $100bn to play with for the next three years; but that falls short of the $120bn that African countries wanted. And that amount was only raised by recycling payments from past loans and leveraging the Bank's balance sheet, as pledges from donors have been flat. Meanwhile the AfDB is battling to persuade donors to replenish its own fund.</p><p>Another idea is to issue more special drawing rights (SDRs), a type of international reserve asset created by the IMF which can be exchanged for dollars and other major currencies. The last allocation, in 2021, helped African countries to plug fiscal holes after the pandemic.</p><p>\"A new issue of special drawing rights is the right thing to do,\" says Vera Songwe, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, and founder and chair of the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility. \"That is the only source of cheap resources. We should do it before the [next] crisis hits.\"</p><p>African countries also want a more effective mechanism for restructuring debt when they run into trouble. Chad, Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia all applied for restructuring under the G20's Common Framework, but bickering between creditors meant the process dragged on for years. Ethiopia's application is still unresolved.</p><p>Suggestions range from suspending debt payments during negotiations to systematic debt relief and even convening a UN convention on debt, similar to the convention that African countries are already demanding on tax.</p><p>\"The most important thing coming out of [Seville] is to get a comprehensive intergovernmental binding process on debt restructuring,\" argues Jason Braganza of the African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (AFRODAD), a pan-African civil society group with head offices in Zimbabwe.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private dreams</h2><p>The other big area for discussion will be the role of private finance, which has not flowed into Africa in the volumes that was hoped. Here, too, macroeconomic turbulence is partly to blame. \"People are holding off on making investment decisions because there is uncertainty,\" says Songwe. \"The advanced countries first of all need to bring some order to their own economies, because the fastest way to growth is that the advanced economies give us some stability.\"</p><p>Institutional investors in the global north, who hold trillions of dollars of assets, remain hesitant about Africa. In some cases they are bound by regulations, such as the solvency capital requirement for European insurers, which make it more difficult to invest in emerging markets. In others they are held back by the view that African assets are too risky - a perception that many in Africa say is unwarranted.</p><p>Data on loans by multilateral and bilateral institutions to private borrowers show that average annual default rates in sub-Saharan Africa are nearly 6%, a couple of percentage points higher than in any other region; but recovery rates are higher too.</p><p>Even when private investors do venture into Africa, they struggle to find bankable projects. Organisations like Africa50, established by the AfDB with the support of African governments, are trying to change that by midwifing projects through their early stages. Over the past year Africa50 has partnered in initiatives ranging from an innovation hub in Rwanda to a renewable energy fund in Nigeria.</p><p>African investors might be a better bet than foreign ones. A recent report by the Africa Finance Corporation estimates that the continent's insurers and pension funds manage $777bn of assets. It suggests that there are big pools of savings that can be deployed into infrastructure projects, although a note of realism is needed. Three-quarters of those assets are concentrated in South Africa. In Nigeria pension funds have grown rapidly, but just 1% of their money goes into infrastructure, and their first duty is to protect the savings of their members. Even in the ageing, wealthy economies of the OECD, large pension funds invest less than 4% of their portfolio in unlisted infrastructure - that which is not owned by publicly traded companies.</p><p>A deeper concern is that a focus on private finance is undermining the prospects for building developmental states. The political economists Daniela Gabor and Ndongo Samba Sylla describe an emerging \"Wall Street consensus\" under which de-risking mechanisms such as credit guarantees are used to transfer risk onto states while leaving profits in private hands. \"Industrial partnerships based on de-risking ultimately surrender the pace and agency of structural transformation to private and mostly foreign capital,\" they write.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The road to Seville</h2><p>Geopolitics will hang like a cloud over the conference in Seville. The US will not be attending, after walking out of talks to negotiate the declaration that will accompany the meeting (<em>see \" Modest progress after the US quits\" below</em>).</p><p>The World Bank and IMF are uncomfortable with a UN process trying to tell them what to do. Patient multilateralism is giving way to a world of bilateral deal-making, from the surge of Gulf investment into Africa to US talks with the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>\"We have talked and talked and talked... but of course if you are the one giving money you know what you want to listen to,\" says Gatete, hinting at the frustration that African countries feel about broken commitments from rich countries in the past. Nonetheless, the gathering in Seville might be their best chance to get heard.</p><p>As Songwe notes, UN-led conferences \"are a little bit more open and more democratic\" than processes led by the G20 or the Bretton Woods institutions, where the rich rule.</p><p>Braganza, the civil society activist, concurs. \"The Financing for Development process is not a pledging conference - it's about changing normative ways of how we do business,\" he says. \"It's about changing the way the global economic system works and democratising it.\"</p><h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h1>",

      "title": "Africa's carbon market awakening: from potential to power",
      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>While Africa bears the brunt of climate change impacts, despite contributing merely 3.9% of global carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, the continent is awakening to an unprecedented opportunity. Africa holds immense potential for nature-based climate solutions yet captures only 16% of the global carbon credits market - a $1.4bn industry projected to reach between $7-35bn by 2030 and potentially $250bn by 2050.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The climate contradiction</strong></h2><p>The statistics paint a stark picture of climate injustice. Africa's average surface temperature in 2024 was 0.86°C above the 1991-2020 average, with North Africa experiencing the fastest warming at 1.28°C above baseline. The continent endured unprecedented flooding, persistent droughts and extreme heat that disrupted agriculture, education and livelihoods.</p><p>Southern Africa experienced its worst drought in two decades, with cereal yields falling 16% below the five-year average. In Zambia and Zimbabwe, yields plummeted by 43% and 50% respectively, while West and Central Africa suffered devastating floods affecting over 4m people.</p><p>Despite this climate vulnerability, Africa's participation in global carbon markets remains dramatically underrepresented. The continent currently hosts over 100 carbon credit projects across more than 20 countries, with a collective offset capacity exceeding 90m tonnes of CO<sub>2 </sub>equivalent annually. However, this impressive project portfolio reflects concerning concentration: renewable energy projects account for 27% of activities, household devices 16%, forestry 14% and energy efficiency 13%, with nearly 90% of recent credit supply historically concentrated in just two project types - cookstoves and deforestation avoidance.</p><p>Africa has utilised only 2% of its vast nature-based solution potential monetised through carbon markets, representing one of the world's most significant untapped opportunities for climate finance and sustainable development.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Economic transformation beyond environmental benefits</strong></h2><p>Carbon markets offer Africa far more than environmental restoration - they represent a pathway to economic transformation and social development. The voluntary carbon market's projected growth positions Africa to capture substantial climate finance flows at a critical juncture in its development trajectory.</p><p>High-integrity African carbon markets could mobilise up to $6bn in climate finance annually by 2030, while supporting up to 30m jobs across the continent. This economic potential extends beyond pure financial returns - carbon market projects directly contribute to at least 10 of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals, creating synergies between climate action and development priorities including poverty reduction, food security, clean energy access and sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Current market signals demonstrate growing investor confidence. The Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) has secured over $1bn in demand-side commitments for African carbon credits by 2030, including $650m in purchase intentions from Standard Chartered, Vertree, Nando's, ETG and the UAE Carbon Alliance, alongside $250m in letters of intent from investors to develop high-integrity projects. Kenya's experience illustrates the transformative potential. The country's comprehensive Climate Change (Carbon Markets) Regulations 2024 established a national carbon registry, mandatory community benefit-sharing mechanisms and alignment with international standards, creating a framework that ensures carbon revenues translate into local development outcomes.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AUDA-NEPAD's strategic leadership</strong></h2><p>As the premier development agency of the African Union (AU), AUDA-NEPAD serves as the continent's primary coordinating mechanism for carbon market development. Our organisation's comprehensive carbon markets study, presented at COP28 in Dubai, identified four fundamental barriers limiting Africa's participation: lack of understanding about carbon market mechanisms, insufficient institutional capacity, absence of regulatory frameworks and limited access to financial resources.</p><p>AUDA-NEPAD's response to the growth of Africa's carbon markets has been systematic and ambitious, providing technical assistance and mobilising financial resources for climate adaptation initiatives and climate-resilient development. </p><p>Our organisation has established the Centre of Excellence on Climate Adaptation and Resilience in Cairo, serving as a hub for innovative research, knowledge generation and capacity building across the continent. Most significantly, following the 37th African Union Summit's mandate in February 2024, AUDA-NEPAD is developing the African Gold Standard for Carbon Offsets - the continent's first indigenous carbon market standard. This groundbreaking initiative addresses concerns about \"carbon colonialism\" by ensuring African ownership and control over certification processes, methodology approval and benefit distribution mechanisms.</p><p>The African Gold Standard represents more than technical innovation-it embodies a fundamental shift toward ensuring carbon markets serve Africa's sustainable development goals. </p><p>The standard, once finalised, will incorporate food security considerations, energy access goals, poverty reduction, job creation and rural economic development alongside climate objectives, with strengthened requirements for community benefit-sharing and transparent revenue distribution frameworks.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strategic partnerships and global collaboration</strong></h2><p>AUDA-NEPAD's approach recognises that Africa's carbon market transformation requires strategic partnerships across multiple scales. Our partnership with the Global Center on Adaptation focuses on the $25bn Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), which has already channelled over $15bn to build climate resilience for nearly 60m people.</p><p>Although climate finance flows to Africa have grown by 48% from $29.5bn in 2019/20 to $43.7bn in 2021/22, with private sector finance nearly doubling to $8bn, this growth represents only 23% of the estimated investment needs for implementing current Nationally Determined Contributions, highlighting the critical importance of carbon markets as a complementary financing mechanism.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Building momentum toward ACS-2</strong></h2><p>The Africa Climate Summit (ACS-2) in September 2025 represents a pivotal moment for showcasing Africa's unified approach to carbon markets. Unlike previous climate summits where Africa has primarily advocated for loss and damage compensation, ACS-2 will position the continent as a solution provider and investment destination.</p><p>AUDA-NEPAD's strategy for ACS-2 centres on demonstrating concrete progress in carbon market development. Several African countries have advanced regulatory frameworks in 2024, including Kenya, Ghana, Mozambique, South Africa, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Egypt, Senegal and Zambia, creating a foundation for coordinated continental action.</p><p>The summit will serve as a platform for launching the African Gold Standard, announcing new investment commitments and presenting bankable projects to international investors. With over 6,200 carbon credit projects registered globally in 2024 and 305m tons of credits issued, Africa's enhanced regulatory frameworks and quality standards position the continent to capture a significantly larger share of this growing market.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The path forward</strong></h2><p>As Africa prepares for ACS-2 and COP30, the continent stands at a unique historical juncture. </p><p>The convergence of growing global carbon market demand, enhanced regulatory frameworks, increasing institutional capacity, and strategic partnerships creates unprecedented opportunities for economic transformation through climate action. The projected growth of voluntary carbon markets to $35bn by 2030 coincides with Africa's enhanced readiness to participate meaningfully in these markets. The African Gold Standard, combined with strengthened national regulatory frameworks and AUDA-NEPAD's coordinating role, positions the continent to capture substantial value from its natural climate solutions.</p><p>Success will depend on continued coordination between AUDA-NEPAD and member states, sustained political commitment at the highest levels, adequate financial resources to support implementation, and effective engagement with international partners and carbon market stakeholders. The measurable targets - $6bn in capital mobilisation and 30m jobs by 2030 - provide clear benchmarks for evaluating progress.</p><p>As the world grapples with the urgency of climate action and the need for massive financial resource mobilisation, Africa's carbon market awakening represents both an opportunity and a responsibility. The continent that has contributed least to global emissions but suffers most from climate impacts is positioning itself to become a critical part of the solution - not through charity or compensation, but through mutually beneficial partnerships that drive economic development while addressing the world's climate crisis.</p><p>The journey from Addis to Brazil will test Africa's unity, resolve and strategic vision. But with AU's leadership, the African Gold Standard's promise and the continent's vast natural potential, Africa's carbon market revolution has begun. </p><p>The question is no longer whether Africa can participate meaningfully in global carbon markets, but how quickly the continent can scale its participation to meet both its development needs and the world's climate imperatives.  </p>",

      "content": "<p>&nbsp;In a bold move to help empower the next generation with early access to financial tools and knowledge, Mastercard and Access Bank (Ghana) PLC have launched an innovative, age-segmented card under the Bank’s youth banking propo­sition, AccessU. This unique offering is designed to empower Ghanaians aged 13 to 40 with essential financial solutions that align with different life stages and evolving aspirations. This new proposition is structured into three key life stages: teens, young professionals, and middle-estab­lished professionals —with each stage offering tailored features that meet the evolving financial needs of Ghanaians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For teens, the offering includes a prepaid or reloadable debit card with parental con­trols, expense-tracking tools, and scheduled allowances, aimed at teaching budgeting, saving, and financial responsibility. In addi­tion, the card offers discounts on gaming, streaming services, and educational platforms. As users transition to young profession­als, the card evolves to include a debit card paired with an entry-level credit card, using soft credit scoring to help first-time borrowers establish credit. This stage also introduces Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) integrations for e-commerce, travel, and gadgets, along with exclusive rewards on subscriptions such as Netflix and Spotify. The offering further sup­ports wealth-building with invest­ment-backed cashback cards. For middle-established professionals, the product expands to premium debit and credit cards that offer travel, lifestyle, career advancement and health insurance benefits, as well as business and SME-linked corporate cards for entrepreneurs and executives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This initiative is part of Access Bank and Mastercard’s broader agenda to close Ghana’s financial inclusion gap. Ghana has a young age structure, with approximately 57 per cent of the population under the age of 25, which empha­sises the importance of initia­tives targeting this age group. By providing accessible, customised financial tools at critical life stages, the collaboration aims to cultivate a financially empowered, digitally included generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This launch reflects our shared commitment with Access Bank Ghana to shape a more financially confident and digitally included generation. By embed­ding financial literacy and secure digital tools from an early age, we are empowering Ghana’s youth to grow into financially responsible adults while also giving families peace of mind and contributing to a more inclusive digital economy,” said Folasade Femi-Lawal, Country Manager and Area Business Head for West Africa at Mastercard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pearl Nkrumah, Executive Director, Retail &amp; Digital Banking at Access Bank Ghana, added: “Our youth are not just the future, they are the now. Through our collaboration with Mastercard, we are not just offering banking solutions to young people, but we are enhancing their job market readiness, creating recruitment opportunities, empowering young entrepreneurs, and equipping them to achieve their dreams and impact Ghana and the rest of the world. This is about giving them agency over their financial choic­es, helping them to thrive, save, spend wisely, and dream bigger.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the broader collab­oration, Mastercard and Access Bank Ghana aim to also design a compelling proposition for women under the Bank’s flagship women banking initiative, the ‘W’ Initiative, further advancing their goal to empower women finan­cially and professionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The age-segmented card will be made available across Access Bank’s physical branches and dig­ital network. This Mastercard-Ac­cess Bank collaboration presents new opportunities for fintechs, merchants and educational partners to engage Ghanaians in more meaningful and responsible ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative also rein­forces Access Bank Ghana’s positioning as a future-focused and youth-centric bank while supporting Mastercard’s commit­ment to advancing financial in­clusion across Africa. The launch sets a new benchmark for how financial institutions can support young people and their families in today’s digital-first economy.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh/mastercard-and-access-bank-introduce-innovative-card-to-empower-ghanaians/\">Mastercard and Access Bank introduce innovative card to empower Ghanaians</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh\">Ghanaian Times</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>As the African Union and European Union mark the 25th anniversary of their unique partnership, the relationship between the two continents stands at a pivotal moment. In this exclusive interview with Capital, Javier Niño Pérez, EU Ambassador to the African Union, reflects on the evolution of AU-EU collaboration, its achievements, and the shared vision driving both Unions forward. With major summits on the horizon and new initiatives like the Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package underway, Ambassador Niño Pérez discusses the challenges and opportunities ahead for sustainable development, peace, and multilateral cooperation—highlighting how this enduring partnership continues to shape the future for over 1.9 billion people across Africa and Europe. Excerpts;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: The Joint Vision for 2030 aligns with Africa’s Agenda 2063 and the EU’s political priorities. How do you ensure that these frameworks complement each other and deliver tangible results for the people of both continents?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>Our Partnership drives sustainable and people-centred prosperity, implementing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/54412/final_declaration-en.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joint Vision for 2030</a>. This Joint Vision was agreed by the African and European leaders at their last <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/international-summit/2022/02/17-18/\">Summit in 2022</a> and it is indeed aligned with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://au.int/en/agenda2063/overview\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Agenda 2063</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/strategic-agenda-2024-2029/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EU’s political priorities</a>. It ensures a strategic alignment around four central pillars: Prosperity, Peace and Security, People, and Planet. These pillars are strong common aims of both Unions’ frameworks and a fundamental platform to get tangible results for European and African citizens. They also, surely, build on each other. Economic prosperity and good governance leads to Peace and Peace allows for improvements in human development and people’s opportunities and rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Unions have teams, in constant contact, that ensure the collaboration is implemented under the Joint Vision and it delivers tangible results. It is one of the main objectives of my own team at the <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/african-union-au_en?s=43\">EU Delegation to the African Union</a>. The high-level meetings, as the <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/looking-back-key-moments-over-25-years-au-eu-partnership_en?s=43\">precedent 6 summits</a> and the upcoming EU-AU Ministerial and the AU-EU Summit, both to take place in 2025, serve to keep the alignment of the political dialogue at the uppermost level, involving both the institutions, its different organs and agencies, and EU and AU Member States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: What role does the AU-EU partnership play in shaping global multilateralism, especially as we approach the 7th AU-EU Summit later this year? With South Africa chairing the G20, how does the AU-EU collaboration leverage multilateral platforms like the G20 to advance shared goals on sustainability and global governance reform?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>Under the Planet pillar of our Joint Vision 2030, we recognise we are, together, a global force for multilateralism and sustainability. As I <a href=\"https://x.com/EUtoAU/status/1915059345240244724\">stated</a> during the recent <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/african-union-au/addis-ababa-celebrates-trio-anniversaries-europe-day_en?s=43\">Europe Day celebration in Addis</a> Ababa, the EU position is that multilateralism is the only way to deal with global challenges, in full respect of the UN Charter. Its fundamental principles &#8211; sovereignty, equality of Member States, territorial integrity, political independence, and self-determination – are the foundation of international peace and security. Of our own protection</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strong EU partnership with the AU and the UN are crucial examples of that. The EU has been a constant supporter of Africa’s legitimate place and voice at the global arena, namely to become a full member of the G20 as the main global forum for international economic cooperation. It is a milestone we genuinely celebrate. It reflects Africa’s essential role in global governance and aligns perfectly with the AU-EU partnership’s vision for a more balanced and inclusive international system. At this fora, EU, AU and respective member states share positions and coordinate efforts to steer political action towards natural aligned agendas: fighting climate change and poverty, debt sustainability, fairer global financial architecture, food security, human-centric AI and digital governance</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, with South Africa leading the G20, we continue this joint effort with determination, supporting a strong African voice at the table and working together on shared priorities like sustainability, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_5881\">renewable energy</a>, green transitions, and meaningful reform of global institutions. It’s a partnership built on trust and mutual goals, and the G20 is one of the key platforms where that plays out. The European Union supports the G20 partnership with African economies South Africa is forging, including through strengthening the G20 Compact with Africa</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AU-EU Partnership been a driver to promote effective multilateralism and a rules based international order role, calling for reforms, as it is expounded in the UN <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/un-new-york/eu-explanation-position-un-general-assembly-pact-future_en\">Pact for the Future</a>. Its adoption sent the clear signal that the global demand for cooperation remains strong and that we need a more just, inclusive, and effective system. The EU supports these efforts, committed to ensuring that the UN is fit for purpose and capable of delivering for all</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the upcoming Ministerial and Summit, strengthen multilateralism will be a main topic, due also to the current turbulent global context.&nbsp; We note with concern growing challenges such as rising unilateralism and protectionism, which undermine collective efforts to address shared challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, unfair trade, global pandemics, rising inequality, irregular migration, organised crime, peace and security</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just recently, on April 24<sup>th</sup>, we marked the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace. I highlight what EU High Representative/Vice-President Kaja Kallas remarked on <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/international-day-multilateralism-and-diplomacy-peace-statement-high-representativevice-president-0_en?channel=eeas_press_alerts&amp;date=2025-04-24&amp;newsid=0&amp;langid=en&amp;source=mail\">her statement</a>: we need to learn from history that isolationism and unilateralism led to painful results and instability.&nbsp;The United Nations was born eighty years ago, after devastating World Wars, to bring together all countries, big and small, into a new era of international cooperation with equal rules, where respect and dialogue would prevail over war. Rule of law over force. She underscores how we face grave challenges to our international order</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://european-union.europa.eu/priorities-and-actions/eu-support-ukraine_en\">&nbsp;Russia’s unprovoked, illegal war of aggression against Ukraine</a> is a direct assault on peace and the very principles upon which the UN was founded. As in many other conflicts raging from the broader Middle East, Sudan Yemen, the DRC and elsewhere. Our commitment to multilateralism is not just a matter of principle—it is a matter of global necessity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the message is clear: no country, big or small, can meet today’s complex challenges alone. The only path is via collective solutions. As&nbsp;the geopolitical context evolves, the EU will continue to be a credible, reliable, and forward-looking defender of multilateralism. And we find in the AU a partner in this journey</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: The Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package aims to mobilize EUR150 billion by 2027. Could you elaborate on how this is being implemented and its impact on regional integration and sustainable growth?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>The <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/initiatives-sub-saharan-africa/eu-africa-global-gateway-investment-package_en\">Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package&nbsp;</a>is a collaborative effort between the European Union, its Member States, and European financial institutions &#8211; in a <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/team-europe-initiatives_en\">Team Europe</a> approach -, and also the private sector and non-governmental organisations. It mobilises investments to drive long-term prosperity through a combination of grants, loans, and private investments (an approach we also call blending). It fosters regional economic integration, sustainable growth, future-oriented infrastructure, and competitiveness of our economies. In concrete, it includes 138 flagships and Team Europe Initiatives that are delivering positive results and transformational impact. Many concrete examples of projects and respective results can be found at the <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/document/4c1aff16-6870-4fd2-9838-2f8bb8bf7772_en\">Joint report European Commission – AUDA-NEPAD</a> published in October and in this factsheet Online</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allow me to give you just a few examples across the five key areas where funding is allocated: a) <strong>Green Transition, </strong>with a focus on secure and renewable energy, including the development of at least 300 GW of additional renewable energy capacity by 2030 and develop clean hydrogen production; b) <strong>Digital Transition, </strong>aiming to enhance digital infrastructure and connectivity across Africa, such as the EurAfrica Gateway Cable and the European Secure Satellite Communications Programme; c) <strong>Sustainable Growth and Job Creation, </strong>including investing in <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/attachment/874232/GG_Africa_Infrastructure.pdf.pdf\">infrastructure and transport across different modes</a>, as well as trade and transport facilitation, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/investing-young-businesses-africa_en\">Investing in Young Businesses in Africa</a>; d) <strong>Health Systems Strengthening, </strong>such asenhancing vaccine manufacturing capabilities – as with the <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/team-europe-initiatives/team-europe-initiative-manufacturing-and-access-vaccines-medicines-and-health-technologies-africa_en\">Team Europe Initiative on Manufacturing and Access to Vaccines, Medicines, and Health Technologies in Africa (MAV+)</a> -, workforce development and digital health solutions, which concretely improves the lives of citizens with more efficient and accessible health assistance. It also includes EU support to crucial bodies like the African CDC and the African Medicines Agency to improve continental disease surveillance, response capabilities and regulatory capacities; e) <strong>Education and Training, </strong>to enhance education systems and vocational training opportunities and to equip the workforce with skills for the evolving job market</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package is a comprehensive approach to fostering sustainable development and economic integration, benefiting in concrete ways the citizens’ lives and prospects</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: Peace and security remain critical issues for both continents. How does the EU support African-led initiatives like the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) in addressing conflicts and promoting stability? How does the AU-EU partnership balance security missions with long-term development goals to ensure sustainable peace</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>Regarding Peace and Security, there is an enhanced cooperation as we reaffirm our commitment to democratic principles, the rule of law, the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights, good governance, gender equality and justice. When both our continents are facing major conflicts with millions of people displaced, we stress the need to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts through dialogue, mediation and preventive diplomacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU has been the reliable, active and main partner for peace in the African continent, namely of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) and Africa-owned security initiatives. We provided more than €3.5 billion, around 2 000 European military personnel, police officers and civil servants working alongside their African counterparts and training. Transport and equipment are provided thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/2025/EU-peace-facility_2025_1.pdf\">European Peace Facility (EPF).</a> The majority of the EU <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/missions-and-operations_en\">civilian and military training and security missions</a> are based in Africa, for example in Horn of Africa/ Somalia, Red Sea, Central Africa, Libya, Sahel/Gulf of Guinea and Mozambique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These efforts are combined with support to frameworks for comprehensive continental responses. The EU support to the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) is in its fourth round. For more than a decade, the EU has contributed to strengthening AU agency and African solutions to African problems. The current programme has as ambition to reduce the incidence, duration and intensity of violent conflicts in Africa. Furthermore, we aim to increase the effectiveness of cooperation within and around the APSA framework, including with Civil Society Organisations, youth, and children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A regular dialogue is ensured and there are frequent meetings between the AU Peace and Security Council (AU PSC) and the EU Political and Security Committee (EU PSC), as just happened on <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/african-union-au/au-psc-%E2%80%93-eu-psc-15th-annual-joint-consultative-meeting-peace-and-security-africa_en?s=43\">22 November 2024.</a> There is a strong focus on development cooperation, humanitarian assistance and human rights, as we share concerns on the consequences of conflicts on civilians, especially the most vulnerable groups. We recognise the importance of engaging women and youth at all levels of peace, security and political processes. We work jointly to address political instability and armed conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism, organised crime, disinformation, piracy, maritime insecurity, cybersecurity and hybrid threats, and climate change and its security implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: What measures are being taken to strengthen governance, rule of law, and democratic institutions across Africa, particularly in regions experiencing political instability?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>The EU stands by the desire shown by African population to live in a democratic and fair society. We support the AU in being more active into preventive diplomacy aiming at conflict prevention and mediation. The EU works with the AUC, RECs and countries on dealing with the root causes of conflicts to prevent their recurrence. This is complex as many dynamics are involved, but we can witness positive signs, for instance when countries require AU assistance in dealing with national elections or to set up the national transitional justice process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our main work is direct to strengthen African institutions in the long term, for example the African Governance Architecture and its organs. For years, we have been among the greatest financial supporters to the African Commission in Banjul, the African Court in Arusha, the Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in Maseru and also the Pan-African Parliament. Our further support in the field of electoral capacity and electoral observation has also contributed to the strengthening of democratic institutions. Stressing more than ever the links between governance, conflict prevention and ensuring peace and security for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The continental level work is complemented by our work at national level, conducted by EU delegations across Africa – who support on the ground election management boards, national human rights commissions, civil society working on this field and other stakeholders. We welcome the role that Youth and Civil Society play and that is why we also include a CSO-Youth Side Event taking place a day before the EU-AU Ministerial in Brussels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: Human development is central to the AU-EU partnership. What initiatives are being implemented in culture and to empower youth and women in Africa, particularly in education, skills development, and entrepreneurship?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>Human development has always been at the heart of the AU-EU partnership. We place particular emphasis on empowering youth and women, especially through education, skills development, and entrepreneurship. As well on allowing a people-to-people connection and cultural interaction to enhance mutual understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples are the gender equality project <a href=\"https://www.spotlightinitiative.org/africa-regional-programme\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spotlight Initiative Africa Regional Programme</a> 2.0, the <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/regional-teachers-initiative-africa_en\">Regional Teachers Initiative for Africa</a>, the <a href=\"https://aueuyouth.com/\">AU-EU Youth Lab</a>, the Opportunity-driven skills and VET in Africa, to train people in a way that responds to the opportunities of the labour market, the expanded <a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Erasmus+</strong></a><strong> program, </strong>cultural exchanges such as <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/african-union-au/maisha-dance-calls4participants-and-new-website_en?s=43\">Maisha</a>, <strong>and </strong>the <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/new-eu-africa-innovation-agenda-enhance-cooperation-science-technology-and-innovation-2023-07-20_en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AU-EU Innovation Agenda</a>, which increases the capacities and achievements of both European and African researchers and innovator and stimulates entrepreneurship and job creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key initiative we are particularly proud of is the <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/global-gateway/youth-mobility-africa_en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Youth Mobility for Africa</a>, which brings together EU-funded programmes that promote learning mobility both within Africa and between Africa and Europe. It also fosters cooperation in higher education and helps position Africa as a destination for study and innovation. We recently launched the <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/global-gateway-eu-launches-new-regional-initiatives-africa-boost-youth-mobility-and-skills-including-2024-04-11_en\">Africa-Europe Youth Academy</a>, under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_22_5882\">Youth Action Plan in EU external relations</a>. Backed by €15 million, it offers young people opportunities for both formal and informal learning, helping them grow their leadership skills and build lasting cross-continental networks. We are also investing €27 million in 15 Intra-Africa Mobility Scheme projects that are active in 22 African countries. These provide students, trainees, and staff with the opportunity to build green and digital skills—key to employability and sustainable growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In close collaboration with the African Union, we also support the #AfricaEducatesHer campaign. It is an initiative in line with the AU’s Continental Education Strategy and it reflects our shared belief that investing in girls’ education is not just a matter of inclusion—it’s a matter of justice and long-term development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: As the EU remains Africa’s largest trading partner, what steps are being taken to ensure that trade agreements are mutually beneficial, particularly in fostering local industries and creating jobs in Africa?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>The EU believes in free, fair and sustainable trade. In the current global context, I want to highlight that 35 African countries benefit from the <a href=\"https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/content/everything-arms-eba\"><strong>Everything but Arms scheme</strong></a>, offering duty free and quota free access to the EU market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Global Gateway investments will have a strong impact on enhancing infrastructure connectivity and, therefore, on regional economic integration. Projects such as for instance the Dakar-Abidjan and the Lobito strategic corridors aim to improve transport links, facilitating trade and mobility between African countries. These are key to progress in the implementation the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). As we experienced ourselves in the EU, the establishment of a continental free trade area, economic integration and promotion of regional value chains, and fostering trade in higher value-added goods and services are key for the prosperity. These bring concrete benefits to companies and people in both continents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU is indeed and by far Africa’s largest trading and investment partner, accounting for about 33% of Africa’s total trade, while Africa is the EU’s fourth trade partner. EU’s total trade with African countries increased by 27% since 2014, with its imports from Africa increasing by 38% and its exports, by 16%. Trade agreements between the EU and African countries, in particular Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), play an important role in strengthening trade and economic relations between the two continents. These have positive impact: trade flows have increased, are gradually</p>\n\n\n\n<p>diversifying, and lead to attract more European investment. Industrialisation often relies on foreign direct investment (FDI) and EPAs support attracting it. EU’s total FDI stock in Africa was EUR 239 billion in 2023. Between 2013 and 2023, EU investment in EPA countries grew by 18% whereas in non-EPA countries, it only increased by 4%. Foreign capital is conducive to additional wealth, jobs, value, and business creation. The EU and AU countries will continue to build on these arrangements in view of increasing and diversifying trade with Africa and investment on the continent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be even more mutual beneficial, EPAs give African countries the possibility to protect certain industries, including so-called ‘infant industries’ that they seek to develop and long phase-in periods for tariff liberalization (up to 15 years). Partners have also been able to keep their market closed to imports of sensitive (notably agricultural) products that are especially susceptible to foreign competition. Moreover, the EU continues to directly support economic integration processes in Africa, which leads to a better investment climate and job creation. This is the way, we believe, for Africa to tap into the full potential of economic integration and trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: How does the AU-EU partnership address challenges related to accelerating green and digital transitions in Africa while ensuring inclusivity and equitable access?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>On the top of the EU agenda is seizing from the twin transitions, conducing them to develop a green and digital fair, human-centred and prosperous society. Both inside the EU and elsewhere in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AU-EU partnership plays a key role in driving the green and digital transitions, essential to unlock economic growth, innovation, and social development, and in addressing its challenges to ensure their benefits are inclusive and accessible to all. Besides Global Gateway investments, I can give you some other concrete examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU and AU have joined hands to develop the “Continental Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) for Africa 2024-2034, which we are already implementing through a number of regional and bilateral EU funded programmes. One excellent example is the EUR 40 million <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/zambia/switch-circular-economy-east-and-southern-africa-switch-2-ce-esa-0_en\">SWITCH to Circular Economy in East and Southern Africa</a> programme, which promotes green and circular business models to mitigate climate change and enhance economic opportunities, at the same time that it empowers women, youth, and marginalized communities through sustainable practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key challenges for digital transition in Africa is the lack of robust digital infrastructure, especially in rural and underserved areas. The EU supports the development of essential infrastructure such as broadband networks, data centres, satellite connectivity, fiber-optic cables and 5G networks. This to ensure wider coverage and improved connectivity for all regions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the digital transition truly inclusive, the partnership places strong emphasis on building digital skills across Africa, namely to enhance digital literacy, focusing on women,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>youth, and marginalized groups. By upskilling the African workforce, the partnership ensures that all people have the opportunity to thrive in the digital economy. It also fosters innovation through initiatives that support digital startups and entrepreneurs in Africa. The EU provides funding and technical support to local businesses working in the digital sector, helping them scale their operations and create new job opportunities. Programs like <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en\">Horizon Europe</a> aim to bring cutting-edge technologies to the continent while promoting the growth of homegrown tech solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A successful digital transition requires strong governance and a clear regulatory framework. The AU-EU partnership collaborates to design an Artificial Intelligence strategy, and, together with African governments, to strengthen digital policies, ensuring they support innovation while protecting users&#8217; rights and data privacy. This includes developing frameworks for data governance, digital trade, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. By aligning regulatory standards between African countries, the partnership helps create a more seamless and secure digital ecosystem that fosters trust and attracts investment. By improving access to digital platforms, the partnership enhances Africa’s participation in the global digital economy, empowering local businesses and entrepreneurs to reach new customers</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: Climate change poses a significant threat to both continents. What joint actions are being taken under the AU-EU partnership to combat climate change and promote environmental sustainability?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>Indeed, and this is exactly why we need to urgently accelerate climate action. The joint focus and investment in renewable energy is definitely crucial. The continent&#8217;s power companies are seeking to sharply boost clean-power generation (focusing mainly on solar and wind), cut reliance on fossil fuels and nearly double total power output within less than a decade. And, the EU has been supporting this, as our investments in green hydrogen and in massive solar energy parks show. There is the need to steer an urgent transformation of our economies into climate-neutral, green, clean and circular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great example is the AU-EU long-term cooperation on renewable energy, the <a href=\"https://www.leap-re.eu/\">LEAP-RE programme</a>. It is co-funded by both African and European partners. That includes governments, research agencies, and other institutions from both continents who jointly define the priorities and co-create the research agenda together. The projects under LEAP-RE focus on renewable energy innovation, capacity building, and creating sustainable energy solutions tailored to African contexts. It’s a great example of how we can address climate challenges together while promoting local ownership and long-term impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The African continent in particular is disproportionately affected by events caused by climate change, even though Africa contributes less than 2% of global greenhouse gas</p>\n\n\n\n<p>emissions to climate change. Therefore, the EU and its Member States assume responsibility for African solutions. For example, we support the approach of the African Risk Capacity, an insurance agency of the AU that intervenes in the event of climate events. I am a member of the ARC Group Board myself in order to live up to Europe’s responsibility here too. I recall the dramatic drought in southern Africa last year, the worst in decades, in which the ARC paid out insurance benefits at short notice, thus saving many lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: How do you envision the AU-EU partnership contributing to global efforts to protect biodiversity, reduce carbon emissions, and build climate-resilient economies?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>We are witnessing an imminent global biodiversity collapse. This might costs us centuries to recover. The severe consequences of climate-change are increasingly apparent in both Europe and Africa. We work with African partners to move forward in implementing COP agreements, the SDGs, the Paris Agreement and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. These are a main joint priority in shaping global agenda in the multilateral system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Africa is blessed by its natural heritage, which is however under threat through unsustainable natural resources management, the expansion of agriculture land, and population growth and the encroachment of human settlement. This has a negative impact on ecosystem services, such as a provision of clean permanent water, which has in turn huge economic and human impacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to learn from nature. This is why the EU promotes a bio-economy and the transition from a linear to a circular economy, as well as nature-based solutions. Besides directing the Global Gateway investment to accelerate the green transition, the EU remains committed to support the AU Biodiversity Action Plan, though the continental NaturAfrica programme and bilateral projects in many African countries. The EU and its Member States cooperate with Africa in the continent’s climate action through various initiatives, namely Early Warning Systems (EWS), access to climate adaptation finance, and Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance (CDRFI) solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: Migration remains a sensitive issue between Africa and Europe. How is the partnership addressing migration challenges while promoting mobility and exchange opportunities for mutual benefit?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>A major concern for both continents is migration and mobility, which continue to shape the shared history and future of Africa and Europe. Migration can be an enormous opportunity, a catalyst for economic, social and human development. It is a main element within the AU-EU Partnership. It is a joint responsibility, based on the principles of solidarity and collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A people-centred approach is at the core of the AU-EU partnership, as it builds structured, multi-level and transparent dialogues between our two continents, notably the Valletta Declaration, the <a href=\"https://www.rabat-process.org/fr/\">Rabat Process</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.khartoumprocess.net/\">Khartoum Process</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.c2cmmd.net/\">Continent-to-Continent Migration and Mobility Dialogue</a>, as well as the Rome Process. EU-African partnership initiatives cover all aspects of the migration by strengthening migration governance and management, fostering cooperation on return, readmission and sustainable reintegration, fighting migrant smuggling and trafficking of human beings. A particular focus is on addressing the root causes of irregular migration &#8211; climate change, conflicts and lack of opportunities – and on enhancing existing legal pathways for migration and mobility. Talent Partnerships have been initiated to link training with labour market needs, offering a skills-based approach to mobility. We work together, and also with other partners such as UN and NGOs, to uphold the dignity, safety, and human rights of all migrants and to ensure the resettlement of refugees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A balanced common migration policy benefits migrants, countries of origin, and countries of destination. Our approach includes protecting and assisting forcibly displaced persons, as well as host communities. We welcome comprehensive, tailor-made and mutually beneficial partnerships with key countries of origin, transit and destination in a whole of route approach, covering all aspects of migration. We promote the integration of migrants while considering the needs of vulnerable groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: The Ministerial Meeting on May 21 will gather over 80 governments along with new leadership from both unions. What key outcomes do you expect from this meeting, especially regarding shared challenges like peacebuilding or economic recovery post-COVID-19? As preparations begin for the 7th AU-EU Summit later this year, what priorities will shape discussions at this milestone event?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>We are now at full speed in preparing these important meetings: the Ministerial on May 21 in Brussels, and the Summit later in Africa. These are the biggest gatherings both sides organise and these are special as they happen when we celebrate 25 years of the AU-EU Partnership and after the change of leadership on both Unions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ministerial is a key moment to take stock of progress, to reaffirm our unwavering collaboration, and recharge the Partnership to keep performing in light of the current and forthcoming challenges. In both events, the priorities to discuss will be the key pillars of Joint Vision 2030 &#8211; Peace, Prosperity, Planet and People. We agree that we need to continue implementing these chosen strategic areas as they are the most important to build future-proof and blissful societies in both continents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One main outcome will be surely the toughen joint commitment to defend and reform the multilateral system, with the Charter of the United Nations at its core, against the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions and geo-economic instability and fragmentation,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>as well as the existential climate crisis, digital pressures and social challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These frequent meetings at the highest level allow us to keep the critical alignment of AU and EU institutions and member states in what and how our Partnership can deliver, to address our common priorities and promote our shared values. They are unique opportunities to discuss how to bring our economies and our peoples closer and to identify areas where we need to deepen our cooperation for the benefit of citizens from both continents. These occasions will also be used to celebrate, to acknowledge and to show results on how our relations have grown in depth, ambition and political importance over 25years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capital: How do anniversary initiatives like joint outreach campaigns help foster understanding among citizens of both continents about the importance of this partnership? What message would you like to convey to African and European citizens regarding their role in supporting this partnership’s vision for prosperity, peace, human development, and sustainability?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ambassador Niño Pérez: </strong>Institutions are only as strong as the trust citizens have on them. On both continents, we need to explain why this Partnership between Africa and Europe is so relevant to the peace and prosperity of all. And also to give them space to voice their concerns and suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary is a silver hook to reach out and explain what the AU-EU Partnership is, why it matters to them, how it impacts their lives. Be it as peace in one country spreads regional stability, as investment in renewables allows them to have secure and cheaper energy in the long run, as strengthen democracy leads to freedom and fair distribution of resources, as it delivers education and work opportunities, access to quality medicine or to a health facility, and to economic growth brought by trade. To allow them to know about opportunities and seize from them. During this year, we are going to give voice to different people, as we gave to <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/african-union-au/youth-policies-and-initiatives-are-key-au-eu-partnership_en?s=43\">Theresa and Roberta to explain how the Partnership puts Youth at its core.</a> Follow more examples at our <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/african-union-au_en?s=43\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EU.Delegation.to.the.African.Union/\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/eutoau\">X</a>, with the <strong>#AUEU25</strong>, and share them with your friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each one of us, as a citizen, is key. We all need to take ownership in our common future and to use all the tools at our disposal to fight for a democratic, fair and peaceful society. As our HRVP said: learn from the past. We are all confronted daily with fake information: my message is to follow and support credible institutions, as well as the quality media, to ensure we all take better decisions. Participate in your community, start your business, be active politically, protect your fellow human beings and the planet. Our future depends on all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://capitalethiopia.com/2025/06/23/celebrating-25-years-of-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Celebrating 25 Years of Partnership</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://capitalethiopia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capital Newspaper</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>&nbsp;The historic Kunsu slave caves, located in the Kintampo North Munic­ipality of the Bono East Region, are undergoing transformation into a world-class prayer sanctuary and ecotourism centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative, led by a private developer, aims to position the site as one of Ghana’s premier tourist and spiritual destinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kunsu Slave Caves, with a circumference of about two kilo­metres, hold significant historical importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oral tradition recounts that notorious slave raiders such as Babatu and Samore used the site as a transit point during the trans­atlantic slave trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slaves were reportedly trans­ported from Salaga in the Sa­vannah Region to Kunsu, where they were kept in caves before continuing to Bono-Manso near Techiman, and subsequently to the coastal forts and castles for shipment overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prophet Okure Asamoah, the developer spearheading the project, told journalists that the site would be upgraded to a global prayer sanctuary fitted with eco­tourism facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explained that the sanctuary would serve both religious and tourism purposes and generate revenue for national development, adding “Over the next three years, the project will see the construc­tion of accommodation and sanitation facilities to make the area habitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a recent visit, construc­tion of temporary shelters was underway, and land was being prepared for religious gatherings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I intend to construct a helipad to allow helicopters to land, and develop modern infrastructure that can attract high-profile personalities including presidents, religious leaders, and tourists from across the world,” Prophet Asa­moah stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He acknowledged the capi­tal-intensive nature of the project and called on private investors to partner with him to bring the vision to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tour guide and local historian, Mr Joseph Asiedu, recounted that the people of Kunsu originally migrated from Nkoranza and settled about four kilometres from the caves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explained that the caves were first used by their ancestors as hiding places during times of war, particularly to protect women and children. This earned the site the name ‘Bougyema’ literally meaning “rocks that keep wives and children.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Asiedu added that over time, the caves became a temporary holding ground for enslaved cap­tives transported from communi­ties such as Prang and Abaase en route to the coast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the historical signifi­cance of the site, several appeals by the Kunsu traditional authority to have the area developed yielded little result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recalled that the Ghana Tourism Authority (GTA) made an attempt in the mid-2000s to de­velop the site but later abandoned the plan, leaving the local commu­nity disheartened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When contacted, the Bono East Regional Director of GTA, Mr Joseph Appiagyei, confirmed the site’s historical value and expressed support for its development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If the private sector is coming on board to help, I will not object. What I will raise concerns about is if their activities conflict with tourism objectives,” he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He pointed out that Kunsu was blessed with several untapped tourism assets, including the historic slave market, slave routes, and waterfalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Appiagyei added: “With the right attention, the area could attract significant visitor traffic and generate substantial revenue for the tourism sector.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;FROM DANIEL DZIRASAH, KUNSU</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh/kunsu-slave-caves-to-be-transformed-into-world-prayer-sanctuary-ecotourism-hub/\">Kunsu slave caves to be transformed into world prayer sanctuary, ecotourism hub</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh\">Ghanaian Times</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>&nbsp;As part of its re­solve to empow­ering vulnerable communities to eradicate poverty, hunger and diseases, an international non-gov­ernmental organisation, World Vision Ghana, has implemented several life-changing initiatives in communities in the Kassena-Nan­kana West District (KNWD) of the Upper East Region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The socio-economic livelihoods, executed under the European Union (EU) Landscapes and Environmental Agility across the Nation (LEAN) project, targeted over 2,000 women and men in 25 beneficiary communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It implemented various inter­ventions which included income diversification, small ruminants, skills training, including soap mak­ing, and growing of seedlings; all under the livelihood improvement of smallholders&#8217; farmers, and the increase forest protection and climate resilience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The project, commenced in 2021, has trained and supported 150 farmers, including persons with disabilities with 300 small ruminants for rearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8221; Under the Savings for Trans­formation (S4T) module, about 60 groups (25 each), have been able to raise GH¢1 million after receiv­ing various capacity building train­ings, such as leadership dynamics, financial literacy, entrepreneur­ship, and business development,&#8221; disclosed Joseph Abugri Talata, Programme Officer, World Vision Ghana, during an assessment tour of the beneficiary communities last Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>World Vision and its partners, with support from the EU LEAN project, he said was committed to seeing to it that a lot of vulnera­ble persons, particularly women, heaved a sigh of relief in their &#8216;sorry&#8217; living conditions by engag­ing in savings to secure a good future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the project inter­vention in providing alternative livelihood opportunities for small­holder farmers and households, he indicated the beneficiaries after receiving the training were gifted &#8220;saving tool kits&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A member of the S4T group at Kadognia, a suburb of Chiana in the Kassena-Nankana West Dis­trict, Felicia Aworigo, said but for the project, her child would have dropped out of school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Every year, I can borrow up to two times or more from our &#8220;Susu group&#8221; to pay my child&#8217;s school fees. My husband doesn&#8217;t have a better job, thus hitherto, our child&#8217;s education was always interrupted&#8221;, she indicated, while testifying the impact of the EU LEAN project, a four-year project implemented by the World Vision in two districts in the north.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cletus Danlugu Awekomba, a teacher and member of the Kado­gnia S4T group, said the module did not only help members of the community to break the poverty cycle, but had helped strengthen social cohesion amongst the folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He brought to the fore that: &#8220;See, I can tell you that a lot of people who were embroiled in a long-standing friction have united to pursue a common cause, thanks to the S4T module of the EU LEAN project. The more the members converge at the meeting venue to discuss issues on the &#8216;Susu&#8217;, the more they interact, thus seeing it necessary to forgive one another&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mrs Benedicta Wugaa, a weaver madam from Banyono, said her life had been transformed tremendously after World Vision International intervened to secure a brand new machine (loom) and other materials under the liveli­hood improvement module of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, about 20 farmers have been trained and supported to establish four nurseries in the district, with logistics to raise more desirable and indigenous free seedlings, such as baobab, mango, mahogany, shea, rosewood, and a host of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Talata told the media that the Landscape Management Board (LMB) had been established, with a seven-person executive council manning it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Robert Dampare-led board, he noted, was charged with the re­sponsibility of undertaking mon­itoring of project interventions across the 25 beneficiary com­munities, &#8220;and as you have heard from the beneficiaries themselves, the contribution of the board members towards the successful implementation of the project has been invaluable, incredible to say the least&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;FROM FRANCIS DABRE DABANG, CHIANA</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh/ue-r-world-vision-creates-livelihood-opportunities-for-vulnerables-in-knwd/\">UE/R: World Vision creates livelihood opportunities for vulnerables in KNWD</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://ghanaiantimes.com.gh\">Ghanaian Times</a>.</p>",

It&#8217;s saddening to see its catalogue of companies grow, but going through the cases makes for interesting reading: the ambition is clear, the market fit seems right, the tech in many cases appears world-class, and yet many stall. This poignant, curious pattern of solid potential meeting sudden death is a puzzle facing the continent&#8217;s innovators. \n</p>\n<p>Several clever Africans have turned their attention to this problem, questioning whether <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/05/29/the-quiet-war-on-startup-imagination/\">capital has become too scared to fund the uncertain</a>, or if <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/05/17/the-invisible-walls-stunting-african-startups/\">our economies are too broken to let good companies survive</a>. Both theories carry troubling weight. \n</p>\n<p>But certainly, a significant part of it is where we get our ideas from. We rightly stand on the shoulders of giants, but to adopt their ideas without deeply tailoring them to the unique dimensions of our own local infrastructure, our own historical contexts, our own socio-economic milieu, can only lead to subpar outcomes. \n</p>\n<p>For the third year in a row, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-06-07/investing-africa-verdict-is-out-on-african-vc-funding\">capital inflows into the continent are falling</a>. The large flocks of tourist investors and high-risk optimists of the last bull run have grown sparse. \n</p>\n<p>Detractors will say we chased scale when we should have built lean. But this new, toothless focus on capital efficiency may be the biggest threat of all, encouraging us to follow set playbooks rather than to critically question. It risks chipping away at the very sector-carving innovative grit that brought us to the world stage in the first place. \n</p>\n<p>I fear we may turn to treating the mere symptoms of rot while the root disease festers, creating ‘sexy’ solutions – as President Tinubu <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AL3qdFccKiQ\">humorously puts it</a> – that fail to shift the needle on the bigger, scrappy problems that could unlock ecosystem-wide value.\n</p>\n<p>It’s time we asked a harder question: <i>Are we playing the right game?</i>\n</p>\n<!--Banner Ad -->\n<p style=\"color: orangered; font-style: italic;\">Next Wave continues after this ad.</p>\n      <div class=\"divider\" style=\"padding: 20px; overflow: hidden;\">\n        <div>\n<img alt=\"The Citizen Report\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/06/image-2.png\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\" />\n<p href=\"#\" style=\"text-align: left; width: 100%; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bolder; line-height: 18px; margin-top: 25px;\">\nCyber Africa Forum (CAF) 2025, the leading platform dedicated to cybersecurity and digital transformation in Africa, bringing together over 6,000 participants from 54 countries and 80 leading companies in the digital and cybersecurity sectors, will hold its fifth edition event on 24–25 June 2025 in Cotonou, Benin. \n<br /><br />\nTwo strategic themes will be at the heart of this year’s discussions: Digital resilience and Accelerating digital transformation. \n</b></p>\n<b>\n<a href=\"https://www.cyberafricaforum.com/\">Find out more here!</b></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Ad end-->\n<br />\n<!--Subtitle-->     \n<div style=\"text-align: left; padding: 0;\">\n<h2 class=\"tc_heading\" style=\"margin-top: 0; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #012384; border-bottom-width: 1.5px; font-weight: 700; line-height: 24px; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px 0px 25px; display: block; color: #000000;\">\nThe scaling game that works (somewhere else)\n</h2>\n</div>\n<!--Subtitle end-->\n<p>The prevailing Silicon Valley playbook, popularised by venture capitalists like Reid Hoffman, is called <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling\">‘blitzscaling.’</a> The math is simple: lose money on nine startups, because the tenth could 100x your investment. The goal is speed and market domination above all else. Prioritise user acquisition, burn cash to grow and achieve a ‘winner-takes-allmost’ outcome. \n\n</p>\n<p>This model is built on a crucial concept known as ‘network effects.’ The value of a service like X or Uber grows exponentially as more people join. This creates a powerful competitive moat, where a user’s decision to join is reinforced by the presence of others. It’s a game of strategic complements, with every new user making the platform more valuable.\n</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of this Valley model, especially before 2022, can be attributed to what economists refer to as &#8216;pre-existing complementarities.&#8217; American startups assume reliable electricity, widespread broadband, mature (and predictable) regulatory frameworks, and established financial systems. They&#8217;re building on top of infrastructure that took decades to develop. In most cases, they only need to build one thing: their product.\n</p>\n\n<p>But African entrepreneurs face what Harvard Business School professors Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu dubbed ‘institutional voids’ – the absence of “specialised intermediaries, regulatory systems and contract-enforcing mechanisms’’ that developed markets take for granted. We have to create (or work around) the complementarities while coordinating, making it a much harder game to win, but potentially more defensible once achieved. \n</p>\n<!-- Chart section-->\n<img src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/06/JN-for-TechCabal-1.png\" style=\"width: 85%; display: block; margin: auto;\" /> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: center;\">African companies chasing scale must play a multi-layer coordination game, building around contexual issues to create complimentaries.</p>\n<!--Chart ends-->\n<p>This creates a fascinating ‘scaling asymmetry&#8217;.</p>\n<p>A Western solution that is designed for a world of abundance often fails when imported into Africa because its foundational assumptions (like constant connectivity, universal credit history, single language) don’t hold. </p>\n<p>This may also explain why African solutions struggle to export: they&#8217;re optimized for different coordination challenges that simply don&#8217;t exist, at least not to the same degree, in developed markets. Solutions become context-specific, reducing their transferability across global markets, other African countries, and sometimes <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sd.2861?__cf_chl_tk=MW7g1ZuytahgQOUjr8Gm4_GdMze6QGRLkx96VEreRHA-1749910665-1.0.1.1-hK8mzy00u6kA5AF_B40j50tC3b_I4PLl5xUYJtXTIC0\">even between neighbouring states/cities.</a> \n</p>\n<!--Subtitle-->     \n<div style=\"text-align: left; padding: 0;\">\n<h2 class=\"tc_heading\" style=\"margin-top: 0; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #012384; border-bottom-width: 1.5px; font-weight: 700; line-height: 24px; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px 0px 25px; display: block; color: #000000;\">\nBut where systems fall short, startups can step in\n</h2>\n</div>\n<!--Subtitle end-->\n<p>Forget how gloomy this all sounds – there’s lots of promise. Technology can fill the institutional voids in African markets, and some companies are already doing it.\n</p>\n<p>Moove is an example I’m particularly fond of. They’re a mobility fintech company that took on the lack of access to credit and asset financing for informal economy workers. Moove created a new infrastructure for credit assessment using alternative data (like driving performance and platform earnings) to underwrite loans, effectively creating credit scores for the unbanked. \n</p>\n<p>By providing the essential asset (the vehicle), Moove solves the coordination problem between drivers who need cars and the ride-hailing platforms that need them on the road. \n</p>\n<p>This pattern repeats across Africa&#8217;s most successful tech companies. \n</p>\n<!-- Chart section-->\n<img src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/06/JN-for-TechCabal-2.png\" style=\"width: 85%; display: block; margin: auto;\" /> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; text-align: center;\">Many successful African companies have thrived by pairing two-sided platforms with fundamental infrastructure &#038; institutional solutions.</p>\n<!--Chart ends-->\n<p>While their specific models differ, they share some common traits: \n</p>\n<p>1. They leverage two-sided network effects on a platform that connects distinct user groups.<br />\n2.

Instead, it tackles the foundational task of making local systems more efficient from the ground up – a nuance the continent&#8217;s most promising startups are already embracing. \n\n</p>\n<p>They are abandoning the Silicon Valley blitzscaling playbook to augment existing informal networks rather than trying to replace them with repackaged, arbitraged versions.\n</p>\n<p>Such a strategy requires a new definition of success. Instead of measuring growth by user acquisition, African companies must consider their impact on ecosystem development. Are they building foundational capabilities (connectivity, logistics, financial rails, etc.) that enable other businesses? Are they solving coordination problems that unlock productivity across multiple sectors?</p>\n<p>Answering these questions requires a fundamental shift from isolated, vertical thinking towards a more holistic, systems-based view for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers alike. </p>\n<p>To do this, we again need questions. Critical ones that aim to expose the rot at the centre of structural failures that demand innovation and invention. Questions like: <i>What exactly are we solving for, and how are our customers finding value in our products, despite institutional voids?</i>\n</p>\n<p>I believe answering these questions puts us on the path to building solutions that endure.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<!--Author signature line-->\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: 700; line-height: 9px; margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;\">\nBy Jeremiah Nnadi\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px; font-style: italic;\">\nJeremiah Nnadi is an MPhil candidate in Technology Policy at Cambridge University&#8217;s Judge Business School.

Why not the Bank Verification Number (BVN)?</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Uzoma Nwagba, managing director of the Nigerian Consumer Credit Corporation (CREDICORP), gave you an answer: &ldquo;If you default on your loan, it could affect your ability to renew your passport, your driver&rsquo;s licence, or even rent a house.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">The idea is commendable because it means that every Nigerian citizen&mdash;as long as you have your NIN&mdash;will have a credit score. This could make it easier to access loans from fintechs, microfinance banks, and, if the big boys want to play, maybe commercial banks too.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">But the BVN has its limits. It only works inside the finance world. But with the NIN, your identity reaches telecoms, tax, and even licencing, giving more sectors access to your credit history.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">This is close (but not the same) to how the US <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssn.asp\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">uses its Social Security Number (SSN)</a>, which tracks income and work years to calculate citizens&rsquo; benefits. Nigeria hasn&rsquo;t said if your earning history will be linked too.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">But if it is strictly borrowing history, it means two things: accessing a customer&rsquo;s ability to pay back a loan&mdash;which is crucial for <a href=\"https://fintechtakes.com/articles/2024-05-22/cash-flow-underwriting/\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">loan underwriting</a>&mdash;will still be a problem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Second, it might also depend on fintechs, banks, and other credit providers&mdash;even loan sharks&mdash;to reliably report when customers take loans from them, thereby contributing to their credit history.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">We cannot say yet if this is a good plan. Rollout will be key. But tell us: does this move get a yay or nay from you?</p>\n                </div>\n                    <div id=\"share_content\" style=\"width: 100%; background-color: transparent;\">\n                        <div style=\"display: table; width: 100%;\">\n                            <div style=\"display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;\">\n                               <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://techcabal.com/2025/05/13/spar-group-enters-the-mobile-space/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/Twitter.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://techcabal.com/2025/05/13/spar-group-enters-the-mobile-space/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/LinkedIn.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                                <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://techcabal.com/2025/05/13/spar-group-enters-the-mobile-space/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/WhatsApp.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n \n  <div style=\"padding: 24px 12px 0;\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%; background-color: transparent; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px;\">\n                    <h5>Save more on every NGN transaction with Fincra</h5>\n                    <a href=\"https://app.fincra.com/auth/signup?_gl=1*2ygohw*_ga*MTA4ODA3Nzk4OS4xNzM5Mjg2NzUz*_ga_KE1ZKSRYGD*czE3NTAxNjIxMTgkbzU0JGcxJHQxNzUwMTYyMTE4JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..*_ga_2R9JL5KJ57*czE3NTAxNjIxMTgkbzUwJGcwJHQxNzUwMTYyMTE4JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..*_ga_Y8QQ441SYV*czE3NTAxNjIxMTgkbzU0JGcwJHQxNzUwMTYyMTE4JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..\">\n                      <img height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/06/unnamed-7.png\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n                    <p>Stop overpaying for NGN payments.

href=\"https://www.zawya.com/en/business/banking-and-insurance/egypt-cbe-issues-licensing-rules-for-payment-system-operators-service-providers-u7yqq7hx\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">has dropped a new rulebook</a> for anyone running a digital payment business in Egypt.&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>By anyone, we mean:</strong> If you&#8217;re handling money transfers, digital wallets, remittances, or payment systems that target Egyptian users, whether you&#8217;re a domestic or foreign company, you&rsquo;re now under stricter watch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\"><strong>Here&rsquo;s what it contains:</strong> These regulations outline the process for obtaining approval and licenses; set the rules for amending licenses; and specify the fees for inspections and supervision.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Everyone must apply for a licence. Existing companies have just 12 months to comply&mdash;they can keep running while the CBE decides if they meet the rules.</li>\n<li style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Foreign companies must be licensed in their home countries.</li>\n<li style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Before launching a payment business, companies must first get the CBE&rsquo;s permission. Once granted, they have 6 months to submit a full licence application, or that approval expires.</li>\n<li style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">The capital requirement for payment system operators is about $9,879,755. Regular payment service providers fall between $197,595&ndash;$592,785.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Applicants must submit a 3-year strategic plan showing how they&rsquo;ll operate, scale, manage risk, and make money.</li>\n<li style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Each company must submit an unconditional financial guarantee, which must be 2% of its capital. The CBE can use this guarantee to impose financial penalties for breaking the rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\"><strong>So, what does this mean?</strong> For startups or global players eyeing the Egyptian market, the bar just got higher. For those who can meet the bar, the path forward is clearer than ever. And for the fintechs that can&rsquo;t? Do they shut down or find ways to merge? Will this new rule trigger the rise of more disciplined, better-funded fintechs?

This service, approved by the Bank of Ghana (BoG), starts with a six-month pilot program in Ghana.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\"><strong>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening:</strong> Onafriq is tapping into PAPSS&rsquo;s infrastructure and regulatory muscle. That means that fintechs, mobile money operators, and traditional partners don&rsquo;t need to build their own compliance or settlement rails. Just plug into the PAPSS framework. While PAPSS handles the backend of operations, Afreximbank, an African Export-Import Bank, makes sure settlements are smooth.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\"><strong>Onafriq and PAPSS are turning their promises into products,</strong> as this new launch comes <a href=\"https://onafriq.com/press/article/mfs-africa-joins-the-pan-african-payment\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">three years after</a> the announcement of their partnership, aimed at promoting intra-African cross-border trade and enhancing financial inclusion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">This new service will allow customers to send and receive money into mobile wallets and bank accounts, enabling faster and more transparent transfers for small businesses and individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">But this isn&rsquo;t just about speed or convenience. It&rsquo;s a challenge to the status quo.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Ghana isn&rsquo;t short on cross-border options with MTN MoMo, Chipper Cash, Wave, and WorldRemit serving this space. But with Central Bank&rsquo;s approval and regional infrastructure in play, this partnership could shift power away from already existing players.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">This move will not kill the competition, but it forces a rethink. For competitors, it&rsquo;s a call to either plug in or risk being left out.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"share_content\" style=\"width: 100%; background-color: transparent;\">\n                        <div style=\"display: table; width: 100%;\">\n                            <div style=\"display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;\">\n                                  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://techcabal.com/category/newsletters/tc-daily/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/Twitter.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://techcabal.com/category/newsletters/tc-daily/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/LinkedIn.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                                <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://techcabal.com/category/newsletters/tc-daily/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/WhatsApp.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n           \n  <div style=\"padding: 24px 12px 0;\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%; background-color: transparent; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px;\">\n                    <h5>Turn your hustle into an online business with Paystack!</h5>\n                    <a href=\"https://paystack.com/storefront/\">\n                      <img height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/06/Blog_Image-1.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n                    <p>Anyone can sell online.

Many of them feared their money had vanished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Mukuru, the Zimbabwe-founded fintech, blamed a technical glitch and said customer funds were safe. The issue, they said, only affected how balances displayed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\"><strong>The update at a glance: </strong>On Friday, the fintech announced that it had fixed the error and restored accurate balances to customer accounts. Several customers confirmed that their account balances were now intact.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Yet, the scare was real, especially for Zimbabwean migrants who depend on Mukuru to send money back home or manage daily spending.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">This kind of thing isn&rsquo;t new in the fintech world, and <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/05/01/nigerian-banks-system-glitches/\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">even in traditional banking</a>. It could have been a bug problem in Mukuru&#8217;s codebase or a temporary display glitch. Yet, Mukuru&rsquo;s users had a solid reason to fret.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\"><strong>Mukuru has a history with fraud:</strong> In August 2024, two Zimbabwean staff members of the fintech company were charged with allegedly <a href=\"https://www.newsday.co.zw/thestandard/local-news/article/200028841/2-mukuru-employees-in-us100k-fraud\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">stealing $100,000</a> through fake accounts on the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">In South Africa, Mukuru customers were hit by a ruthless SIM-swap scam where criminals <a href=\"https://www.saps.gov.za/newsroom/msspeechdetail.php?nid=57600\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">stole R18 million ($1 million)</a> from their accounts. The crooks tricked mobile providers into giving them control of customers&rsquo; phone numbers. With that, they were able to gain access and log into accounts. While it wasn&#8217;t the Mukuru app that got hacked, users asked questions of their fund&rsquo;s safety.</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px 0; margin: 0;\">Due to the recent mishaps, the account balance glitch came at a bad time. Mukuru may need to do more to prove their systems can be trusted, else the fintech risks losing a good chunk of the 17 million global users it now serves.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div id=\"share_content\" style=\"width: 100%; background-color: transparent;\">\n                        <div style=\"display: table; width: 100%;\">\n                            <div style=\"display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;\">\n                                  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://techcabal.com/category/newsletters/tc-daily/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/Twitter.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://techcabal.com/category/newsletters/tc-daily/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/LinkedIn.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                                <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://techcabal.com/category/newsletters/tc-daily/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline; width: 24px; height: 24px; background-color: #eeeeee; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border-radius: 2px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2023/05/WhatsApp.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" width=\"16px\" /></a>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n<div style=\"padding: 24px 12px 0;\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%; background-color: transparent; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px;\">\n                    <h5>Qore Group appoints Michael Hoodfar as COO.</h5>\n                    <a href=\"https://qore.inc/\">\n                      <img height=\"auto\" src=\"https://c76c7bbc41.mjedge.net/wp-content/uploads/tc/2025/06/unnamed-8.png\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n                    <p><a href=\"https://qore.inc/\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">Qore</a> Group appoints <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michael-hoodfar-92930214\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #B61313 !important;\">Michael Hoodfar</a> as COO, driving 16x growth and market reach expansion globally with expertise from Thought Machine, Deutsche Bank, Accenture, Deloitte &amp; PwC.

      "content": "<p>Contact Financial Holding, Egypt’s leading non-bank financial services and insurance provider, has reported a powerful start to the year, posting a 306% year-on-year (YoY) surge in consolidated net income for the first quarter of 2025, reaching EGP 59 million. The group’s total operating income also saw a robust 30% YoY increase, rising to EGP 475 million, underscoring the company’s strong operational momentum and strategic shift toward high-margin and digitally enabled financial solutions.</p>\n<p>In a statement announcing the results, Contact’s management highlighted the company’s renewed strategic focus:</p>\n<p>“Contact’s strong first-quarter results reflect the impact of our strategic pivot toward higher-margin products and the resilience of our business model, supported by gradually improving economic conditions. The exceptional performance from our insurance division, which recorded a 767% increase in net income, has further strengthened our growth trajectory.”</p>\n<p>Insurance Division Steals the Spotlight</p>\n<p>The insurance segment emerged as the group’s fastest-growing division, delivering unprecedented performance. Insurance revenue surged by 73% YoY to reach EGP 619 million during Q1 2025, driven by strong contributions from both Sarwa Life and Sarwa Insurance. Gross written premiums (GWPs) climbed 54% YoY to EGP 1.07 billion, underlining the group’s expanding footprint in Egypt’s insurance market.</p>\n<p>Operating income from the insurance business soared by 242% YoY to EGP 109 million, while net income recorded a staggering 767% YoY increase, reaching approximately EGP 43 million—a nearly ninefold jump compared to the same period last year. The group attributed this growth to improved underwriting margins, expanded product offerings, and increased market penetration across key customer segments.</p>\n<p>Financing Division Remains a Steady Performer</p>\n<p>Contact’s financing division also delivered solid results, with operating income up 14% YoY to EGP 372 million. Net profit for the division increased to EGP 27 million, reflecting a 33% YoY rise. This performance was supported by the group’s continued emphasis on credit quality, portfolio diversification, and innovative financing products that cater to both individuals and SMEs.</p>\n<p>Fintech and Digital Platforms Driving Future Growth</p>\n<p>The group continues to push the boundaries of digital transformation in Egypt’s financial services sector. Its flagship platform, ContactNow, has positioned itself as Egypt’s first all-in-one digital financial marketplace. The app has witnessed growing traction, enabling customers to access a wide array of financing products, apply for loans, and complete purchases with flexible payment options—ranging from cash to tailored installment plans.</p>\n<p>During the quarter, Contact enhanced the app’s user experience by launching a new end-to-end digital purchase journey, enabling seamless product discovery, credit application, and payment integration. This move is part of the group’s broader effort to accelerate fintech adoption, improve customer acquisition, and deepen cross-selling opportunities.</p>\n<p>Strategic Outlook</p>\n<p>With a strong start to the year, Contact Financial Holding appears well-positioned to capitalize on Egypt’s evolving financial landscape. The company is benefiting from favorable macroeconomic conditions, increasing demand for non-bank financial services, and rising digital adoption among consumers.</p>\n<p>Analysts have pointed to Contact’s balanced portfolio, innovative technology platforms, and operational discipline as key factors that will continue to support its upward trajectory throughout 2025.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/22/contact-financial-holding-delivers-stellar-q1-2025-results-with-306-yoy-net-income-surge-fueled-by-soaring-insurance-and-fintech-growth/\">Contact Financial Holding Delivers Stellar Q1-2025 Results with 306% YoY Net Income Surge, Fueled by Soaring Insurance and Fintech Growth</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com\">Dailynewsegypt</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Egypt’s Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Hani Sewilam, and Minister of Agriculture, Alaa Farouk, traveled to New Valley governorate to inspect progress on what is expected to become the world’s largest date farm—part of a national initiative to expand agricultural exports and transform desert land into productive farmland.</p>\n<p>The visit aligns with President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi’s directive to plant 2.5 million date palms in the western desert region, positioning Egypt as a global leader in date production. During the tour, both ministers planted palm trees to mark the project&#8217;s advancement and reaffirm the government’s commitment to agricultural development.</p>\n<p>The ministers also visited the Central Groundwater Laboratory and the Sustainable Development Center for New Valley Resources—research institutions affiliated with the irrigation and agriculture ministries. Minister Sewilam underscored the importance of equipping laboratories with state-of-the-art technology and building technical capacity to enhance groundwater monitoring and desert water resource management.</p>\n<p>Sewilam noted that the laboratory is internationally accredited through December 2025 and plays a central role in safeguarding groundwater—a vital but non-renewable resource that supports Egypt’s desert farming projects. He emphasized the need for strict regulation and responsible groundwater usage to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>\n<p>Minister Farouk highlighted the Desert Research Center’s work in cultivating non-traditional, drought-tolerant crops such as quinoa, panicum, and cassava—better suited to Egypt’s arid climate. He also pointed to the government’s unprecedented investment of more than EGP 1trn in reclaiming approximately 4 million feddans of desert land, with per-feddan development costs ranging between EGP 250,000 and EGP 300,000.</p>\n<p>Accompanied by New Valley Governor Mohamed El Zamlout, the delegation toured an exhibition featuring the center’s work in seed banking, organic fertilizers, and greenhouse agriculture. Farouk called for continued technical support for local farmers and the expansion of agricultural outreach programs to raise productivity and promote sustainable practices.</p>\n<p>He added that wheat yields have improved significantly, with productivity increasing by nearly one ardeb (around 150 kg) per feddan, helping Egypt exceed last year’s wheat procurement by over 500,000 tonnes.</p>\n<p>The visit reflects Egypt’s broader national strategy to modernize agriculture, boost exports, and ensure long-term food security by transforming its vast desert regions into thriving agricultural zones.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/22/egyptian-ministers-visit-mega-date-farm-project-to-boost-agricultural-exports/\">Egyptian ministers visit mega date farm project to boost agricultural exports</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com\">Dailynewsegypt</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Egypt has launched a nationwide initiative to raise awareness about sudden cardiac death and improve the country’s emergency healthcare response through widespread training in the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs). The campaign, unveiled on Sunday, reflects a coordinated effort by the Ministries of Health and Youth and Sports to prevent cardiac-related fatalities and build community-based resilience.</p>\n<p>The announcement was made during an official ceremony held at the Olympic Center in Maadi, Cairo, attended by Health Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Youth and Sports Minister Ashraf Sobhy, senior healthcare officials, and leading cardiologists.</p>\n<p>“This initiative represents a critical step forward in preventing sudden cardiac arrests within the community,” said Abdel Ghaffar, noting that an estimated 55,000 people in Egypt die each year from sudden cardiac arrest, with around 20% of these cases caused by ventricular fibrillation. He emphasized that timely intervention with an AED can raise survival rates to over 90%.</p>\n<p>The initiative includes training personnel across government institutions and youth centers, equipping them with the skills needed to respond effectively to cardiac emergencies. Abdel Ghaffar also announced the development of a mobile application to provide users with step-by-step guidance on using AEDs, performing CPR, and responding to emergencies.</p>\n<p>Youth and Sports Minister Ashraf Sobhy underscored the importance of integrating AEDs and trained responders into sports venues across the country. “We must ensure that all sports clubs and federations implement regular emergency response training programmes, especially during athletic competitions,” he said.</p>\n<p>As part of the broader strategy, the initiative also includes mandatory routine and specialized medical screenings for athletes to detect potential heart conditions before they escalate.</p>\n<p>Mohamed Sobhy, president of the Scientific Foundation for Cardiology and Arteries, praised the initiative for reflecting “a comprehensive scientific approach to reducing mortality from cardiac arrest.” He noted that the programme is in line with international best practices and includes a strong emphasis on training and deploying AEDs in public areas.</p>\n<p>Hazem Khamis, head of the medical committee at the Ministry of Youth and Sports, highlighted the critical importance of AED accessibility, stating that “having defibrillators available in public spaces during the first few minutes of cardiac arrest can be the difference between life and death.”</p>\n<p>The initiative has received strong support from both public and private sectors, including the Egyptian Red Crescent, the Scientific Foundation for Cardiology, sports clubs such as Wadi Degla, and multiple athletic federations. Together, these partners aim to foster a culture of preparedness and ultimately reduce preventable deaths from sudden cardiac events.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/22/egypt-launches-national-initiative-to-combat-sudden-cardiac-death/\">Egypt launches national initiative to combat sudden cardiac death</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com\">Dailynewsegypt</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The escalating confrontation between the United States and Iran reached a dangerous new phase after US President Donald Trump announced a “highly successful” strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities—an action that analysts warn could plunge the region into a full-scale war.</p>\n<p>Speaking from the White House, Trump said the operation targeted the nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, declaring that the Fordow facility was “finished” after a full payload of precision-guided bombs was deployed. “Now is the time for peace,” he said, following the announcement.</p>\n<p>According to a source quoted by Reuters, Iran had preemptively moved most of its highly enriched uranium from Fordow and had reduced staff presence at the site ahead of the strike.</p>\n<p>In swift retaliation, Iran launched dozens of missiles at Israel early Sunday, in what officials are calling the most direct and dangerous confrontation yet between the two states. Israeli authorities reported at least 27 injuries, with rockets striking Tel Aviv and Haifa and causing significant damage to infrastructure and residential areas.</p>\n<p>Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz praised Trump’s actions, calling them a “historic decision” and emphasizing that the targeted strikes were meant to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. “This is a pivotal moment for regional security,” he said.</p>\n<p>In Washington, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes had “erased Iran’s nuclear ambitions,” stressing that the operation was carefully designed to avoid civilian casualties. “Any retaliation from Iran will trigger a significantly stronger response,” he warned.</p>\n<p>Vice President J.D. Vance confirmed that the Fordow facility had sustained extensive damage, calling the mission “a major military success.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that “the world is safer and more stable today,” and reiterated that the United States remains open to renewed dialogue with Iran, despite the operation.</p>\n<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sharply condemned the strikes, calling them an “unforgivable international crime.” He ruled out any talks with Washington “as long as acts of aggression continue.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Iranian state media reported that the Iranian parliament approved a motion to close the Strait of Hormuz, pending final approval from the country’s Supreme National Security Council—a move that could disrupt global oil flows.</p>\n<p>Although the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that no radiation had been released from the targeted nuclear sites, concerns remain over potential environmental fallout should the attacks continue.</p>\n<p>In response to Iran’s missile barrage, the Israeli military launched additional airstrikes on Sunday targeting drone and missile bases in Isfahan, Bushehr, Ahvaz, and, for the first time, Yazd. According to Israeli military sources, 30 fighter jets were deployed in the operation.</p>\n<p>The financial cost of the ongoing conflict is mounting. Israeli media reported that over 32,000 damage compensation claims have been filed, with the total cost of the week-long conflict estimated at 12bn shekels—including 5bn shekels allocated to missile defense systems.</p>\n<p>Calls for de-escalation continue to intensify. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry urged all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire and pursue a political resolution to the crisis. Cairo also held urgent consultations with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Jordan, emphasizing the need to uphold national sovereignty and prevent a broader descent into regional chaos.</p>\n<p>France, Germany, and the European Union joined the chorus of international concern. The EU’s foreign policy chief labeled the situation “extremely dangerous” and reiterated that preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons remains a global security imperative, adding that diplomacy is the only path forward.</p>\n<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that Iran’s nuclear program poses a “serious threat” to international security and called on Tehran to re-engage in negotiations immediately.</p>\n<p>Regional powers, including Qatar, the UAE, and Kuwait, expressed deep concern over the escalating conflict and warned of catastrophic consequences for regional stability if hostilities are not curtailed.</p>\n<p>While Israeli officials publicly denied plans for further escalation, the Financial Times reported that some senior figures within the government favor halting additional operations following the US strike—though they noted that Iran’s next move would likely determine the trajectory of the conflict.</p>\n<p>On the ground, Iran’s judiciary announced the arrest of seven individuals on charges of espionage and terrorism amid fears of further unrest. A senior commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard vowed continued attacks on Israel, declaring that “the Zionist entity will not enjoy peace.”</p>\n<p>In a rare statement, Yemen’s Houthi movement voiced solidarity with Iran, condemning the US and Israeli strikes as “Zionist-American aggression” and violations of international law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/22/us-strikes-iranian-nuclear-sites-as-tehran-responds-with-missile-barrage-on-israel/\">US strikes Iranian nuclear sites as Tehran responds with missile barrage on Israel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com\">Dailynewsegypt</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport and Industry Kamel Al-Wazir, along with Minister of Housing Sherif El-Sherbiny, inaugurated the 10th Builders of Egypt Forum on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The forum marks a significant step as Egypt prepares to host a major international event focused on sustainable urban expansion, with a spotlight on transforming coastal areas—particularly the development of New Alamein City into a global destination for tourism and investment.</p>\n<p>Key themes of the forum include the integration of advanced technologies for managing coastal cities, optimizing natural resource use, and addressing the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. The event also highlights successful global case studies in green and smart urban investment.</p>\n<p>As part of its broader “New Republic” vision, Egypt has launched 14 coastal cities that are redefining the nation’s border governorates as thriving tourist and economic hubs. These cities, which form part of Egypt’s fourth-generation urban development strategy, vary in size, location, and project scope. Leading examples include New Alamein, Ras El Hekma, Marina El Alamein Center, and the cities of Sidi Barrani, El-Negaila, El-Salloum, New Rashid, New Mansoura, New Port Said, and New Bir El-Abd.</p>\n<p>Several countries are adopting similar strategies to capitalize on their geographic advantages, aiming to build new tourist cities that spur economic growth and increase foreign currency inflows. The forum serves as a platform for presenting such ambitions, offering investment opportunities that benefit both local and international stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Government representatives and industry leaders will share their visions for continuing sustainable development programs and discuss planned initiatives to support key sectors—especially construction and its associated industries. The forum also sheds light on the evolution of construction companies in terms of technical capabilities, management structures, and the adoption of innovative implementation tools.</p>\n<p>Another central focus is fostering collaboration among Egyptian construction firms across various specialties, with the goal of expanding the export of contracting services throughout the region. The event promotes partnerships aimed at enabling qualified companies to extend their operations to international markets.</p>\n<p>Egyptian construction companies have played a pivotal role in driving the country’s recent urban transformation. Their expertise in deploying advanced building technologies has been instrumental in executing flagship projects such as the high-rise residential towers in the New Administrative Capital and New Alamein, as well as critical infrastructure developments, including roads, bridges, and power networks.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/22/egypt-to-host-global-forum-on-coastal-urban-development-sustainable-cities/\">Egypt to host global forum on coastal urban development, sustainable cities</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com\">Dailynewsegypt</a>.</p>",

He reaffirmed ACUD’s ongoing commitment to supporting serious developers and accelerating progress on this national megaproject, which stands as a pillar of Egypt’s “New Republic” vision.</p>\n<p>Midtown Solo features fully serviced standalone villas, targeting a high-end clientele. Abbas confirmed that 95% of infrastructure works for the project’s first phase have been completed, with final utility connections pending developer compliance with technical specifications. He also noted that landscaping and main roadworks across the R7 district are progressing in phases and will be completed soon.</p>\n<p>Fahmy highlighted that Midtown Solo is Better Home’s second project to be delivered in the New Capital, and lauded its architectural quality and integrated services. He stressed that such developments are key to drawing more residents and investors to the city.</p>\n<p>To further support developers, Fahmy revealed that ACUD has introduced 4 to 5 facilitation packages, helping struggling companies resolve issues and expedite license issuance. He also acknowledged Better Home’s early and continued investment in the Capital, noting the company&#8217;s pivotal role in believing in the city’s long-term potential.</p>\n<p>He added that investor interest remains strong, citing a recent electronic land offering in the R8 district that drew three times the available applications.</p>\n<p>Ashraf Adel, General Manager of Better Home, emphasized the company&#8217;s pioneering role as the first private real estate developer to acquire land in the New Capital. He described Midtown Solo as a landmark development, and the only project in the Capital comprised entirely of standalone villas—390 in total—spanning 66 acres along the prominent South Bin Zayed Axis, near the Cathedral and Green River.</p>\n<p>Adel highlighted the project’s low-density design, with 80% of the land devoted to greenery, landscaping, and lagoons, and only 20% for built structures—creating a tranquil and healthy living environment. Residents benefit from a full suite of amenities, including a clubhouse, swimming pools, restaurants, cafés, and pharmacies.</p>\n<p>The development sold out in record time, reflecting strong market confidence in the Better Home brand. It also features a 30,000 sqm commercial hub made up of 14 standalone buildings (ground + 2 floors + rooftop + private basement). Each unit starts at 1,250 sqm, with 1,100 sqm of outdoor space and a 940 sqm basement, designed to serve both residents and the broader community.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/22/better-home-group-completes-midtown-solo-delivery-in-new-administrative-capital/\">Better Home Group completes Midtown Solo delivery in New Administrative Capital</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.dailynewsegypt.com\">Dailynewsegypt</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Monday signed a new law allowing civilians to be tried in military courts that critics said could be used against opposition leaders ahead of next year&#8217;s election. The new law comes despite a ruling by the Supreme Court in late January that it was unconstitutional for civilians to be tried in military courts as was the case for opposition leader Kizza Besigye. Besigye, 69, was abducted by armed men in Nairobi in November and re-emerged a few days later at a military court in Uganda, where he was charged with treason, which carries a potential death penalty. Following the Supreme Court ruling, his case was moved to a civilian court. But the new law provides for &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; under which civilians can be subjected to military law, including the &#8220;unlawful possession of arms, ammunition or equipment,&#8221; one of the other charges Besigye is facing. The signing of the law was announced by Uganda&#8217;s parliament on X. Besigye&#8217;s lawyer Erias Lukwago told AFP the law was designed to facilitate the &#8220;illegal detention and trial of Besigye and others&#8221;. Besigye has been in jail for more than the six-month legal limit for detention without trial.

Africa CDC said the deployment of its technical experts to Amhara in late April 2025 contributed to several “critical response pillars,” including surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), risk communication and community engagement (RCCE), and operational capacity building for the region’s Incident Management System (IMS). “The major outcome,” said Dr. Aniekeme Aniefiok Uwah, Africa CDC’s Senior Country Representative to Ethiopia, “was a significant reduction in the daily number of cholera cases reported.” &#8230;Africa CDC reported that the outbreak in Amhara, which began in January 2025, has resulted in over 2,281 confirmed cases and 15 deaths. The agency said the outbreak has been “exacerbated by the influx of pilgrims and fragile water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure at these sacred sites.” (Addis Standard)</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://capitalethiopia.com/2025/06/22/africa-cdc-reports-daily-cholera-cases-decline-in-amhara-attributes-progress-to-joint-response/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Africa CDC Reports Daily Cholera Cases Decline in Amhara, Attributes Progress to Joint Response</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://capitalethiopia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Capital Newspaper</a>.</p>",

      "description": "Zimbabwe’s government can use the critical minerals surge to empower communities and foster inclusive development",
      "content": "<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Africa, which holds <a href=\"https://www.africangreenminerals.com/minerals/rare-earth-minerals\">significant estimated shares</a> of the world’s total reserves of bauxite (24%), cobalt (49.4%), copper (7%), graphite (21%), lithium (6%), manganese (43%), nickel (4.2%) and rare earth minerals (2%), is at the centre of a global race for critical minerals required in the clean energy transition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exploitation of these resources should help to boost trade, industrialisation and development, but Africa’s track record is littered with examples to the contrary. Resource booms become drivers of corruption, conflict and ecological destruction and weaken governance institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the continent’s economic problems, rapidly expanding population and mounting environmental pressures, there is a closing window of opportunity to ensure this new wave of mineral extraction breaks from historical patterns to become a catalyst for inclusive economic growth and long-term sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimbabwe’s lithium sector exemplifies both the opportunities and dangers inherent in the global race for critical minerals — a subject explored at a May 2025 conference hosted by the Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) titled <a href=\"https://cnrgzim.org/news/zimbabwes-critical-minerals-a-call-for-equitable-and-responsible-mining/\">Ensuring Equitable Distribution of Costs and Benefits in Critical Minerals Development</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lithium, used in consumer electronics (including batteries), electric vehicles and renewable energy systems, has become an essential mineral to many of the modern industries driving economic prosperity and the global transition to clean energy. As drone warfare continues to revolutionise modern warfare, access to lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries has also become an important <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/30/1095439/usa-economic-security-competitiveness/\">national defence</a> issue from Washington to Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimbabwe is endowed with substantial lithium reserves. Since 2021, the sector has attracted more than $1.2  billion in foreign direct investment, with <a href=\"https://chinaglobalsouth.com/analysis/zimbabwe-lithium-sector-chinese-investment-challenges/\">exports</a> surging 800%, from $7 million in 2021 to $600  million by 2024. Investment in the sector has been <a href=\"https://energycapitalpower.com/investments-in-zimbabwean-lithium-to-drive-domestic-refining-capacity/\">dominated</a> by Chinese companies including Rwizi Rukuru, Shengxiang Investments, Sinomine Resource Group, Chengxin Lithium, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and Yahua Group. This investment in the sector has been <a href=\"https://miningzimbabwe.com/interview-winston-chitando-minister-of-mines-and-mining-development/\">highlighted</a> by Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando as crucial to the government’s wider national development <a href=\"https://www.veritaszim.net/sites/veritas_d/files/NDS.pdf\">strategy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as <a href=\"https://gga.org/tag/muzarabani/\">shown</a> in previous research by Good Governance Africa and the CNRG, Zimbabwe’s mining sector often fails to translate into broad-based economic prosperity. Several mining operations have also been associated with incidents of human rights abuses, corruption and environmental degradation, with local residents disproportionately suffering the adverse consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surging demand for Zimbabwe’s critical minerals presents a defining choice for both government and mining investors: they can either leverage this opportunity to empower local people and foster inclusive development or fall back into familiar patterns of exploitation. During conference proceedings, several measures were highlighted as necessary to maximise Zimbabwe’s chances of seeing the former option.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, Zimbabwe’s mining sector requires comprehensive legal and governance reforms to unlock its potential for inclusive development. The current system, which vests mineral rights in the president and is administered through the mines and mining development ministry, creates opacity and excludes key stakeholders from decision-making processes. Transferring these rights to an independent regulatory body subject to parliamentary oversight and accountability would enhance transparency and ensure broader participation in mining agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneously, fast-tracking the implementation of a comprehensive mining <a href=\"https://portal.miningcadastre.org/zw/CustomHtml.aspx?PageID=d7f3f61d-4689-4280-a59a-b865f002dd60#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20Mining,must%20first%20Register%20for%20access.\">cadastre system</a> is essential for providing real-time, accurate records of mining claims and licenses. This technological infrastructure would serve as a foundation for reducing corruption, limiting discretionary decision-making and aligning Zimbabwe’s mining sector with international standards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, prioritising beneficiation to stimulate industrial development and local job creation is essential. In this respect, Zimbabwe passed the <a href=\"https://www.veritaszim.net/sites/veritas_d/files/SI%202022-213%20Base%20Minerals%20Export%20Control%20%28Lithium%20Bearing%20Ores%20and%20Unbeneficiated%20Lithium%29%20Order%2C%202022.pdf\">Base Minerals Export Control</a>&nbsp; (2022), which includes a ban on raw lithium exports by 2026 to encourage investment in local processing facilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 10 June 2025, the minister also announced <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/zimbabwe-ban-export-lithium-concentrates-2027-2025-06-10/\">a ban</a> on the export of lithium concentrates by January 2027. Although these measures were designed to maximise benefit through localised processing of lithium, a <a href=\"https://cnrgzim.org/news/zimbabwes-delayed-value-addition-and-beneficiation-plans-threaten-economic-development/\">CNRG press statement</a> in response to the minister’s pronouncement noted with concern that “this urgent reform is being delayed into irrelevance”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Graphic Gga Minerals Website 1000px\" class=\"wp-image-674126\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Graphic-GGA-Minerals-Website-1000px-772x1000.png\" width=\"772\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">(Graphic: John McCann/M&#038;G)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This, as CNRG further highlighted, “should be with immediate effect to prevent further natural capital depletion from unchecked lithium exploitation, which has devastating socio-economic and environmental implications. Zimbabwe’s lithium wealth risks being squandered, as unchecked exports, weak regulation and opaque deals undermine its potential for industrial transformation”. Local minerals beneficiation does not always make economic sense. But, where the opportunity for value addition is clear, it must be taken and supported through coherent industrialisation policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further to this, China monopolising the sector could undermine these efforts, with Chinese companies <a href=\"https://chinaglobalsouth.com/analysis/zimbabwe-lithium-sector-chinese-investment-challenges/\">already</a> leveraging their position to <a href=\"https://futures.issafrica.org/blog/2025/Zimbabwes-lithium-beneficiation-policy-a-catalyst-for-Vision-2030#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20Kuvimba%20Mining%20House%2C%20Zimbabwe's,refineries%20and%20battery%20manufacturing%20plants.\">undermine</a> local beneficiation initiatives. Diversifying investment in the sector by addressing governance issues (currently deterring many Western investors) and leveraging opportunities such as the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act and the US Minerals Security Partnership (aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains) would help to strengthen Zimbabwe’s negotiating position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good step in this direction was the first <a href=\"https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/eu-business-fora/european-union-zimbabwe-business-forum-2025-2025-05-20_en\">European Union-Zimbabwe Business Forum</a> held from 20 to 22 May, focused on renewable energy and mining investments, among other aspects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond diversifying investment partnerships, realising the intentions of the Base Minerals Export Control will also require concerted investment in the infrastructure required for local beneficiation projects to operate effectively, a consistent regulatory environment, and decisive action against corruption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, strategic resource management should balance national sovereignty with economic pragmatism to maximise benefits from Zimbabwe’s mineral wealth. Moving away from disadvantageous long-term trade agreements while avoiding excessive nationalisation will help Zimbabwe capture fair value during price fluctuations without deterring necessary investment. Central to this approach is the need for long-term planning that addresses resource depletion through economic diversification strategies and sovereign wealth mechanisms, on condition that these be well governed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth, community empowerment and <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/thought-leader/2025-06-18-mining-of-critical-minerals-tramples-grazing-and-water-rights-in-zimbabwe/\">rights protection regarding land and water</a> should be prioritised to ensure that local populations benefit from, and participate in, decisions affecting their areas. There is a need for ongoing, comprehensive government and civil society-driven capacity building programmes to educate people about critical minerals, associated opportunities and potential risks, enabling informed participation in mining-related decisions. Community involvement is a principle provided for by the Constitution on national development, and in the <a href=\"https://ucaz.org.zw/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT-ACT.pdf\">Environmental Management Act</a>t. But the implementation of these provisions remains a problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this respect, international best practice frameworks such as the <a href=\"https://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/\">Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights</a> provide useful guidelines on how mining companies, civil society and government can play a role in advancing these goals. But creating the conditions under which these can be effectively implemented will require the Zimbabwean government to address long-run governance and human rights issues, as well as creating an enabling environment for civil society to operate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, environmental sustainability and social responsibility must guide Zimbabwe’s approach to critical mineral extraction, ensuring that the pursuit of economic benefits does not compromise long-term environmental and social well-being, particularly for the mining communities. Mining operations should be required to adopt cleaner technologies and implement robust mitigation measures, including cleaner coal technologies, where fossil fuels remain necessary for processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humanising the broader energy transition can be achieved&nbsp; through gradual, community-sensitive steps rather than disruptive changes that harm rural livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upgrading Zimbabwe’s obsolete energy infrastructure is essential for supporting both mining operations and broader economic development while improving national energy security. By embedding environmental and social considerations into mining policies from the outset, Zimbabwe can position itself as a responsible supplier of critical minerals while building a sustainable foundation for long-term development that benefits all citizens rather than perpetuating historical patterns of exploitation and exclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sikhululekile Mashingaidze is the lead researcher in Good Governance Africa’s Peace and Security Programme and Stephen Buchanan-Clarke is the head of the programme.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<p><strong><em>In Day 1–1000, we follow founders through the raw, unfiltered journey of company-building: the early scrambles, the quiet breakthroughs, the painful pivots, and the milestones that shape what a business becomes.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first encountered Axel Peyriere, co-founder of Auto24, as an angel investor after he had shared one of my stories in his weekly LinkedIn tech news roundup. Peyriere is  French and Australian. He loves people, food, music, travel, and cars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a decade travelling across Asia and Africa, Peyriere began angel investing in African startups in 2011—Bumpa, Monaco, Curacel, Termii, Grey and a few others are among his portfolio companies.  In 2016, he founded a  mobility startup, AfriCar, inspired, I believe, by his passion for cars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peyriere is my guest this week on Day 1–1000. He talks to me about how his startup went from being a lean network of 45 automobile classifieds&#8217; websites to an asset-heavy used car marketplace operating in five African countries. The day of our interview marked 1,095 days since the company’s pivot from its first iteration as a digital classifieds platform to the launch of Auto24. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the story of Auto24 as told to TechCabal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 1: Classifieds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, my co-founder Fredrik [Orrenius] and I set out to build digital infrastructure for Africa’s used car market. I had worked across emerging markets in Asia and believed many of the conditions I saw there—fragmented supply, limited online marketplaces, and an absence of transactional trust—also existed in sub-Saharan Africa. Fredrik, who brought deep operational experience, joined me in building what became AfriCar Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We launched the company from Australia and rolled out 45 automotive classified websites across 45 African countries. Each website had a local name to build market-specific trust and avoid unnecessary branding costs. At the time, Facebook Marketplace had just launched, and OLX hadn’t yet penetrated much of sub-Saharan Africa. People were still buying and selling cars through neighbours or informal networks. Our classified sites offered a new layer of transparency, however basic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model was simple. We didn’t own the inventory. Sellers paid to boost their listings. Dealers paid for premium slots. It was lean, low-margin, and slow. But in many countries, we quickly became the number one or number two platform. When capital-heavy ventures like Rocket Internet’s CarMoody came and crashed, we survived. We were leaner. More local. Less fragile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then COVID hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"list-newsletter-form shortcode\" id=\"list-newsletter-form\">\n    <h2>Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox</h2>\n

Ad revenue disappeared. Dealers froze their marketing budgets. For a few weeks, it felt like the engine had stalled completely. But something unexpected happened. Car manufacturers and distributors—Toyota, CFAO, and others—started reaching out from markets like Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, and Zambia. They wanted help managing leads. They needed digital infrastructure. We said yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those early B2B consulting engagements gave me a new perspective. I realised the opportunity wasn’t just in helping others digitise—it was in building a full-stack, transactional marketplace ourselves. I had seen the model work in other emerging markets. Kavak in Latin America. Cazoo in Europe. I knew we could do the same in Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2022/09/16/stellantis-and-africar-partner-to-launch-auto24-a-used-car-marketplace/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stellantis invested</a>. That gave us the capital to pivot into what we’d long imagined but hadn’t yet built. That’s how <a href=\"https://auto24.africa/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Auto24 was born</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea was simple but ambitious. We would buy used cars from consumers and fleets, inspect and recondition them, attach warranties and refund policies, and resell them—this time with trust as the core product. We launched first in Côte d’Ivoire, where I already understood the market and spoke the language. Within three months, we had a working operation. Mechanics in garages. A showroom. A live website. The first ten cars sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2023/09/28/auto24-expansion/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">then expanded to</a> Senegal, Morocco, Rwanda, and South Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 1825: Building with local talent</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Auto24 employs 220 people across five countries. Our team sizes vary by market, from 30 to 80. Each operation is localised. There are no expats. All hires are local. Our managers, mechanics, sales reps, and marketers all come from the countries we serve. That’s a deliberate choice. You cannot build trust from the outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each market behaves differently. In Côte d’Ivoire, consumers prefer Suzuki and Toyota. In Morocco, Peugeot dominates. In South Africa, it’s Ford and SUVs. Our pricing, messaging, and even our social media strategy adapt accordingly. Morocco doesn’t sound like South Africa, and our teams shouldn’t either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since pivoting, we’ve increased our revenue by x500. Today, we operate across several supply chains—consumer-to-business, business-to-consumer, and business-to-business. But the most powerful model is consumer-to-business-to-consumer. We buy cars directly from individuals, inspect and recondition them, then sell directly to other individuals. It’s cleaner. The margins are stronger. And most importantly, the trust flows both ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were the first company in these markets to offer six-month warranties on used cars. We introduced refund policies—drive 200 kilometers and bring the car back if you’re not satisfied. That only works if you believe in your product. We do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our average vehicle sells for about $15,000. Inventory ranges from $7,000 to $100,000, but most sales are SUVs with automatic gearboxes. We’ve also started to push into EVs. We were among the first to do that in several countries. I believe it’s early, but necessary. The market will eventually shift. We want to be ahead when it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"list-newsletter-form shortcode\" id=\"list-newsletter-form\">\n    <h2>Get the best African tech newsletters in your inbox</h2>\n    <form

last decade building and investing in emerging markets. Before Africa, I was investing in startups across Southeast Asia—Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar. What I saw in Asia ten to fifteen years ago is exactly what I see unfolding in Africa now. But here, the scale is bigger, and the velocity is faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People often underestimate how long it takes to build something that works. It took us six years of classifieds before we found true product-market fit. The pivot to Auto24 didn’t happen overnight. It came through resilience, a willingness to listen to what the market wanted, and the conviction to rebuild from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask me if I’ve ever wanted to quit, I tell them no. This is just the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An investor recently asked if I’d consider selling the company. I said no, again. I know what we’re building. I can double, triple, even quadruple it. That’s not ego. That’s execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe mobility is infrastructure. And infrastructure is something you build over decades, not funding cycles. Governments won’t build mobility systems fast enough. Private companies will. That’s why we’re not just selling cars. We’re building the operating system for used car ownership in Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be more unicorns in African mobility. Auto24 be one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mark your calendars!&nbsp; Moonshot by TechCabal is back in Lagos on October 15–16!

      "content": "<p>In Nigeria today, <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/06/17/dell-laptop-prices-in-nigeria/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the rising cost</a> of brand-new laptops has pushed many consumers towards fairly used or “second-hand” systems. While these pre-owned devices offer a more affordable option, many buyers end up with laptops that barely last three hours on battery, despite paying between ₦150,000 and ₦300,000 ($90-$190 at $1/₦1,600) or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common mistakes buyers make is asking, “How strong is the battery?” without actually checking the battery health themselves. In reality, battery degradation is a major issue with used laptops, and ignoring it could mean spending a lot of money on a device that’s practically useless without constant power supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we’ll show you how to check battery health on any Windows 10 or Windows 11 laptop, whether you’re buying a UK-used system or you simply want to check the health of the laptop you already own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why checking battery health matters</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a student, gamer, remote worker, or tech entrepreneur, a healthy battery is key to mobility and productivity especially in a country like Nigeria where power outages are common. A laptop that can’t last long without being plugged in is a liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checking battery health before you buy helps you avoid regrets. And if you already own the laptop, it helps you plan ahead before the battery fails completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Method 1: How to generate a battery health report using Windows PowerShell or Terminal</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This method is built into all Windows laptops and gives you a detailed, technical report on battery performance over time. Here’s how to use it:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Step 1:&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Right-click the Start Menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>On Windows 11: Select Terminal (Admin)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On Windows 10: Select Windows PowerShell (Admin)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Step 2:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Click Yes if a security prompt appears.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Step 3:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Type the following command and press Enter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>powercfg /batteryreport /output &#8220;C:\\battery-report.html&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Step 4:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open File Explorer (press Windows + E)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Navigate to This PC &gt; Local Disk (C:)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Look for a file named battery-report.html</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Double-click the file to open it in your browser.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t see it immediately, use the search bar in File Explorer to search for &#8216;battery-report.html&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Step 5:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once opened, the report will display:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Installed Batteries – Basic information about the battery</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cycle Count – How many full charge cycles the battery has gone through (too many cycles may indicate an ageing battery)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Capacity vs Full Charge Capacity:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Design Capacity = what the battery could originally hold</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full Charge Capacity = what it can currently hold</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the full charge capacity is significantly lower, the battery is worn out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 6:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Scroll to view these key sections:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Recent Usage – Shows battery drain over time</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battery Capacity History – Tracks capacity decline</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battery Life Estimates – Compares current battery life to when the laptop was new</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Method 2: Use a free app – Pure Battery Analytics</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For users who prefer a simpler, visual option, the Pure Battery Analytics app on the Microsoft Store is a great alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to Use It:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open the Microsoft Store on your laptop</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search for “Pure Battery Analytics” and install it</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app and view:</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Battery Design Capacity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full Charge Capacity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Remaining battery life</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battery wear level</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Real-time usage analytics</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bonus: What else to check before buying a used laptop</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery life is only part of the equation. Before handing over your money for a UK-used laptop, make sure to inspect the following components:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keyboard – Are all the keys working?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>USB &amp; Charging Ports – Do they connect and detect devices properly?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Touchpad – Is it responsive and accurate?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Screen – Any dead pixels, cracks, or flickering?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>If you already own a laptop&#8230;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monitoring battery health is part of good maintenance. Here are some tips to help prolong your battery’s lifespan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Avoid overcharging. Let the battery drop to around 20–30% before recharging occasionally.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep your laptop away from dust, heat, and water.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean the fan vents periodically to prevent overheating.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use Battery Saver mode when running on power.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t rely on what sellers say—check for yourself. Whether you’re buying a used laptop or maintaining the one you already own, regularly checking your battery health can save you from costly surprises and downtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

      "description": "Unlike Iran, Israel is not a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons",
      "content": "<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The perversion of multilateral institutions using seemingly benign resolutions as quasi-declarations continues. Consequently, the multilateral system is slowly collapsing. The election of Donald Trump as United States president has further complicated the situation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has pulled the US out of a number of multilateral agreements, including the Paris Accord on climate change. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is accused of selective justice when it comes to the prosecution of those charged with crimes against humanity — of only targeting African leaders and ignoring Western leaders who are accused of similar crimes. The ICC ignored calls to charge former British prime minister Tony Blair and former US president George Bush for crimes against humanity when they falsely asserted that Iraq’s Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolution that Iran was in breach of its proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years was a precursor to Israel’s attack on Iran.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resolution was adopted by the IAEA’s board of governors on 10 June; three days later Israel attacked Iran. The resolution was passed by 19 votes in favour, three against and 11 abstentions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of the report and the speed with which Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, acted on it has raised questions. When did he know about the resolution? How did he manage to prepare Israel’s attacks on Iran in such a short space of time? Was he given prior knowledge about the content of the resolution?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netanyahu, who has always scorned talks with Iran, took advantage of the resolution and the changes in the Middle East since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023. Israel has always claimed that Iran poses an existential threat to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This follows a statement made by Iran’s former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in 2012 at the United Nations. Ahmadinejad said Israel has no roots in the Middle East and would be “eliminated”. He was criticised for uttering an inflammatory statement and ignoring a UN’s warning to avoid incendiary rhetoric ahead of the annual General Assembly session. Netanyahu has been beating the war drum against Iran ever since, arguing that “Iran has to be stopped on its tracks before it is too late”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 191 countries that are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), making it one of the most widely adhered-to arms control agreements. But four nuclear weapons states — India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea — are not signatories to the treaty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The treaty’s objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to achieve nuclear disarmament. The IAEA, an agency of the UN, is responsible for monitoring nuclear activities and obligations of countries party to the treaty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Africa has a nuclear power station generating 5% of the country’s electricity. The country ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in February 2019 and was the first country to have disarmed its nuclear weapons. Fearing that these could end up in the wrong hands, South Africa ended its nuclear weapons programme, which began during the 1970s, in 1989. The decision was executed just months before negotiations on ending apartheid between the National Party (NP) and the ANC started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an important decision which facilitated a smooth political transition in South Africa. Otherwise, global powers could have delayed or derailed the political transition. According to Ali Mazrui, a Kenyan intellectual, the NP was under pressure from various quarters to prevent what he referred to as the “Black Bomb” from being transferred to an unknown black political leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Graphic Nuclear Website 1000px\" class=\"wp-image-674113\" height=\"723\" src=\"https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Graphic-Nuclear-Website-1000px.png\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">(Graphic: John McCann/M&#038;G)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to the Middle East. Who is presenting an existential threat to other nations in the Middle East? Who possesses nuclear weapons in the region? There is a wide belief that Israel has nuclear weapons. The estimates are that it has nuclear stockpiles of between 90 and 400 nuclear warheads. According to political analyst Msano Zive, it is Israel that poses an existential threat in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manner in which Israel has continued with the genocide in Gaza, its willingness to starve and suffocate civilians in Gaza and its disproportionate response to the attacks on 7 October 2023 has never been experienced in modern times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel is intent on committing the same atrocities in Iran. The destruction of property in Gaza and the number of deaths, including those still lying under the rubble, resemble a country that was struck by an atomic bomb, Zive argues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel has not ratified the non-proliferation treaty, meaning that the IAEA’s monitors have no access to its nuclear programme. The world should be concerned. Israel has continually violated national sovereignty and security of its neighbours. Other than continuing to commit genocide in Gaza, it is relentlessly bombing Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and now Iran. Netanyahu’s political survival and avoiding jail time is dependent largely on the continuation of the war in the region. Israel’s failure to destroy Hamas in Gaza has led to Netanyahu to search for new targets. Iran has been the low-hanging fruit for a long time, given the national sentiments on Iran in Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IAEA has to ensure a nuclear weapon-free and responsible world. Importantly, it also has to ensure that those who possess nuclear weapons and run nuclear related programmes act responsibly and adhere to the basic rules and regulations of the treaty. Importantly, the role of the IAEA of encouraging a nuclear weapons-free world has to be promoted. It is important therefore how the IAEA deals with Iran; it has to be seen to be fair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran ratified the non-proliferation treaty voluntarily. Why is it then harassed by a country known to possess nuclear weapons that refuses to ratify the treaty and scrutiny by the IAEA? The continuation of these double standards is likely to encourage other countries in the world who intend to produce nuclear weapons from being open about their plans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thembisa Fakude is a senior research fellow at Africa Asia Dialogues and a director at the Mail &amp; Guardian.</p>",

      "description": "A values-based, empathetic and compassionate leadership style is necessary to address issues such as poverty and inequality",
      "content": "<p>Our political leadership could learn a lot about embodied, empathetic and compassionate leadership from a vlog by the dynamic young musician, Zintle Kwaaiman. In it, Kwaaiman cries, deeply moved by witnessing the plight of people affected by abject poverty in a place she had just visited.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her tears were born of compassion for the people and of frustration that the leaders who have the power to change that situation were not doing enough, fast enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What she described in her vlog was what Hennie Swanepoel and Frik de Beer, in their book Community Development: Breaking the Cycle of Poverty, refer to as “the deprivation trap”.&nbsp; This is characterised by five realities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Powerlessness</strong>: Lack of social and economic influence. It’s also the ease with which people can be exploited.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Exclusion from systems and structures that can change their lives.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Poverty:</strong> Lack of productive assets such as land, money and income-generating skills.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Physical weakness</strong>: Malaise, lack of physical strength and exposure to chronic illnesses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Lack of reserves and choices, which drives the ease with which the poor can be coerced.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As I watched Kwaaiman lamenting her powerlessness to effect the change needed at the scale and speed necessary, I wondered whether our political leadership, who have the power and the resources to change the situation, have any compassion for the plight of the poor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they ever allow themselves to feel the pain of the pangs of hunger, the fear of crime and the hopelessness of lack of income? I wondered if the leadership cared about people’s lives. Or do they just simply go through the motions, talking about “our people”, yet do not care deeply. This is what I call “out of sight, out of mind” leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/south-africa\">Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2023</a>, “South Africa struggled to realise economic and social rights because of increasing inequality and unemployment, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and corruption. The country also failed to take concrete steps to address environmental pollution and the dangers posed by toxic waste to people living close to abandoned mines and dams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Between 2021 and mid-2022, 400 000 to 500 000 children dropped out of school in South Africa, bringing the total number of out-of-school children to 750 000, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund. Teenage pregnancy was identified as one of the reasons why children drop out of school in the country. Over half a million children with disabilities are excluded from education,” the report noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To remedy the above, to muster the level of decisive action needed to transform the economy, improve service delivery, create conducive conditions for income generation, lift people out of poverty and combat corruption, South Africa requires a new leadership framework. It needs an embodied and compassionate leadership which is able to feel deeply for the people, because at the centre of the human being is the “heart” or the “inner being”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It informs our cognition, affections and volition. What the heart loves, it will pursue. If it loves self, it will abandon empathy for the poor. If it loves others, it will think, act and feel in a way that truly serves the least of these.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a leadership firmly undergirded by ethics, good governance, compassion and care. We need a shift toward embracing embodied, empathetic and compassionate leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for this reason that Good Governance Africa (GGA) is partnering with Values 20 South Africa, a global community of values experts and practitioners seeking to actively work with the G20, providing it with evidence-based, human-centred policy solutions that contribute to overcoming global problems. Its focus is on how we, as global citizens, can collectively and consciously apply values to the benefit of the planet and the people who inhabit it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GGA shares this vision and is continually striving to embed effective democratic processes — in which the voices of citizens are really heard and responded to — across Africa through its programmes and projects. So, this synergy with Values 20 is a natural one and we hope that, together, we can have more impact in the relevant policy spheres.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his book The Art of Somatic Coaching: Embodying Skilful Action, Wisdom and Compassion, Richard Strozzi-Heckler tells the story of a Mr Duffy who lived a short distance from his body. He says Mr Duffy was a one-dimensional bureaucrat who lived a bland, colourless life. “He is the postmodern everyman — cut off from his feelings, defined by rules and protocols, drifting aimlessly without purpose or meaningful connections.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the article <em>Embodied Leadership: A Cure For What Ails Us?, </em>which appeared in<em> Forbes</em><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginnywhitelaw/\">Ginny Whitelaw</a> states that “without the inner work of embodiment, leadership can’t fully do its outer work”. <a href=\"https://www.revealingwisdom.com/blog/what-is-embodied-leadership\">Embodied leadership</a> is about feeling deeply, being present and observant, “using the wisdom of your body alongside your mind to lead yourself and others in a way that’s authentic, aligned and impactful”. This practice is about integrating our heads and our hearts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginnywhitelaw/\">Whitelaw </a>is correct when she says, “At a time of deep divisions and discontent, the dissociations of head from heart, of talk from walk, of action from a felt sense of its consequences, are wholly inadequate for dealing with the wicked issues we face.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When leaders are distanced from themselves, like Mr Duffy, they lose the embodied feelings for others necessary for effective leadership. This prevents them from feeling the pain of the majority and undermines their resolve to take the actions necessary to implement change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, we seem to have an abundance of such leaders, from the local to provincial and national levels, travelling from meeting to meeting and making speech after speech. They are good at raising points of order and pontificating in legislative chambers, yet the resources at their disposal with which to effect material changes in people’s lives continue to be embezzled without consequences. Hence, we need to embed the value of embodied leadership in our body politic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claire Yorke and Maria Sklodowska make a compelling argument in their essay, Is Empathy a Strategic Imperative? about the strategic importance of empathy in offering solutions to policy failures. They argue that, when empathy is used wisely, it engenders the value of what we in South Africa call batho pele (putting people first) and creates new approaches to dealing with intractable governance problems in new ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They state that, “If strategy is about achieving certain desired ends and meeting core objectives — whether in warfare, politics or policy — then empathy is critical to understanding the contours of the human landscape in which such aims are to be achieved.”&nbsp; It is for this reason that empathy should “sit at the heart of government, built into how the government approaches its strategic vision and aiding the longer-term pursuit of its national objectives and international standing”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the value of empathy built into our governance systems, the future of society is doomed. But, with empathy at the core of our leaders’ way of being and their decision-making, humanity’s future is bright.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Laura Segovia-Nieto and Andres Ramirez-Velandia, in their paper, titled Do We Need Empathy or Compassion in Our Political Leaders? A Case of Colombian Political Leaders, leaders need to embrace the value of compassion, not only empathy. They state that, “Empathy as the core of social engagement allows us to share others’ psychological experiences, but it does not entail necessarily the need to act toward specific community well-being. Compassion, on the other hand, drives action to relieve the discomfort of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Due to the importance of the target in the definition of compassion, political leaders must choose which sector of their nation deserves their compassionate actions, even though empathy lets him or her understand other national actors’ situations.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Kwaaiman, our political leaders appear to be numb and indifferent to the plight of the sectors of society who live in squalor and poverty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For leaders to embrace the value of compassion, they need more proximity to the people. I am not talking about the occasional dropping in to electioneer and cutting ribbons. I am talking about an embeddedness in the human struggles of the poor that opens the leader’s eyes and ears to see and hear them. It is in this connectivity that compassion will take root. If leaders do not expose themselves to the conditions and experiences of people, they will never identify with them and they will never have the impetus to make changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problems South Africa is facing will not be addressed successfully with mechanistic, legalistic and formulaic solutions. We cannot construct genuinely pro-poor policy that will generate broad-based development without compassion and empathy. Policy built in a way that is congruent with ubuntu is likely to be the most implementable too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To burst open the deprivation trap and release the poor from its clutches, we need a values-based — not an out of sight, out of mind — form of leadership in South Africa. An out of sight, out of mind form of leadership is careless, clueless and indifferent. We need embodied, empathetic and compassionate leaders to lift us out of the quagmire we are stuck in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Patrick Kulati is the chief executive of Good Governance Africa’s Southern African regional office.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The electricity cable to my house has broken. I know this because four weeks after the power switched off in the last week of April, a truck visited and assessed the cable. They came on the day that my partner called a radio station to complain about living in prolonged darkness. We were told that the cable had broken at the base of the street pole. Fortunately for everyone, they would not need to dig up the road even as they warned that the cable to the house is old and will need to be replaced at some point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They repaired the break in the cable, but the lights stayed off because there was something wrong with the meter. They temporarily bypassed the meter and left us with a caution; the power was now on the neutral cable and posed some risk. Instead of darkness, we chose the power we were given. It lasted a week. I write this piece five days into the darkness, on the coldest week of the year so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another call was logged with City Power. Over the past six weeks many calls have been made. The call centre agents eventually respond by picking up the phone and then ignoring us while they continue their conversations. On their system, they count the number of calls received but to them, this is a game. In a landscape of so much unemployment, for them, work is a plaything. When we eventually escalate to a supervisor, promises are made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we languish in the dark. Our municipal account has arrived. It is just over R11  000. While the bill has arrived, the power has not. Before the power switched off in the week of Freedom Day, for several weeks, the electricity voltage had been low and only some appliances and lights worked. Touching some taps and shower knobs sent a jolt of shock through the body. And then everything went dark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are firmly middle class in my household. We have it better than most residents of this city. We shower at the gym, we cook on a gas plate stove, and we charge our computers and devices at work. We live. But the middle-class trappings and security systems that we need to protect ourselves from the inequality of this city are gone. We cannot use the electrical security system, the gate battery has died, and there are no outside perimeter lights. In the darkness of this broken city, we are sitting ducks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are black and we are not suffering from a native nostalgia for the apartheid city of the past. But it was not always like this. We would know because we have lived in our house for 15 years. Like everyone, we experienced the blackouts of load-shedding. Then, our suffering was shared. Now, as the lone house without power, no one knows our fate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cannot log it with EskomSePush or the city’s X account. Without the pressure of an entire neighbourhood, our calls can be ignored. The City Power trucks that drive by the neighbourhood know us. We sometimes stop them and direct them to the house. We are prepared to entertain their requests for cold drinks — code to compensate them for their paid work. Corruption is in the marrow of this city.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous years, when technicians have come for repairs on the problematic electric pole, they have asked us for money to buy electrical parts because these have supposedly run out at the warehouse. Waiting for stock means there may be delays which could take weeks or months. So, we give them what they ask for. They buy the parts and fix the problem. But because this is generally only patchwork, the problem often reemerges. The next person criticises the work of the previous technician. We pay again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the illicit economy of a failing city of ageing infrastructure and city officials that have lost their hold over the city they supposedly manage. As residents that know nothing about electrical parts, we are at the mercy of officials who may or may not be corrupt. One thing is apparent though; the city’s residents are rendered vulnerable by a city that pretends to know what it is doing but is failing spectacularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I call my mother in Lusikisiki, she is empathetic. We share notes about when to cook all the meat in the fridge before it spoils. She often has no electricity because the wind is sometimes too strong for the lightweight Eskom infrastructure in the village. Or a donkey might have rubbed itself against the electric pole. In the villages, power outages can take weeks to resolve. We wrongly expect this because we have come to accept that rural life is cheap and unimportant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is jarring when this becomes the norm in the economic heart of the country where we pay inflated municipal rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collapse of Johannesburg is in full swing. The ruin of the central business district has been self-evident for a while now. The gas explosion of Lilian Ngoyi Street might be read as the final confirmation of a known truth. The lethargic repairs tell us all we need to know about the city’s capabilities. Townships have been held in place by the sheer ingenuity of their residents. They navigate sink holes and sewage leaks. They no longer bother with City Power. They climb the poles and connect themselves. To fix a common problem, they conduct a collection and pay the cold drink fee of a rogue city employee.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The middle-class suburbs have been the last line of defence to a decent life. But in the tree-lined streets, the ominous signs of decay are here too. Potholes poke holes into the middle-class bubble. If residents do not fix pavements, kerbs and street walks, they degenerate because the city will not repair anything now. All this at our own cost. I know this from firsthand experience. When flood waters washed away the pavement outside my yard, I repaired it at the cost of R20  000 after a year of reporting it to the councillor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long lines periodically emerge when water runs out of many areas of the city. At the same time, water and sewage pipe bursts release water and faecal matter which run down Louis Botha Avenue unchecked. Shit splatters in the wake of the roaring traffic. Breathe in the droplets at your risk, dear resident.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story is the same: ageing city infrastructure, but there is no end date given for when it will be changed. Water tanks poke over people’s walls as residents take on the role of municipalities. Those who can’t afford private water wait for water tankers. Solar panels are everywhere. The cost of living here has ballooned in the last decade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city is not just fraying at the edges. It is broken.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is to be done? Our mayoral office has been a revolving door of failures. I don’t believe a change in those who don mayoral chains is the solution. The recycling of a former mayor of Cape Town with colonial longings does not excite me. Sitting in this dark place, I don’t know what is to be done. There are people that are paid to vision and implement plans. Chief executive officers, city managers and committees with dizzying salaries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate need is simpler than a vision or solution. All I really want is reliable electricity. I pay the bills, now could I have some power please?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hugo ka Canham is a writer and professor at Unisa and the author of </strong><strong><em>Riotous Deathscapes</em></strong><strong>.

      "description": "\"If you default on your loan, it could affect your ability to renew your passport, your driver’s license, or even rent a house.\"",
      "content": "<p>The Nigerian government has moved to adopt a unified national credit system that links individuals’ credit score to their National Identification Numbers (NIN), to enable financial institutions to access comprehensive and traceable credit profiles of customers seeking loans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was announced by Uzoma Nwagba, Managing Director of the Nigerian Consumer Credit Corporation (<a href=\"https://www.credicorp.ng/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CREDICORP</a>) during a press engagement at the State House in Abuja, on Tuesday, June 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He stated that all financial institutions including banks, fintechs, and microfinance are to report citizens’ credit history, including loan repayment, linked to their NIN. Nwagba added that the move will transform credit accessibility by encouraging inclusive and responsible borrowing, and reward financial discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a fundamental shift in how credit works in Nigeria. Your NIN will now serve as the anchor for your credit profile. Whether you borrowed from a commercial bank, a microfinance institution, or a digital lender, that data will now be traceable and carry real consequences,” Nwagba said. “If you default on your loan, it could affect your ability to renew your passport, your driver’s license, or even rent a house. There will be no hiding place.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial institutions <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/06/11/how-do-banks-and-fintechs-determine-your-credit-worthiness/\">have varying factors</a> for assessing creditworthiness of customers. Traditional banks rely on rule-based scoring using turnover thresholds and BVN-linked credit histories (accessible through the Central Bank&#8217;s credit check software) to evaluate creditworthiness of corporate entities or customers with structured income, mostly excluding regular customers due to high-risk of default. Fintechs leverage algorithms and digital footprints, mostly smartphone data to assess credit score, but often charge higher interest rates to offset the risk of loan defaults.</p>\n\n\n\n<div

bureau, open to all financial institutions and key government agencies, meaning credit behaviour could also influence access to non-financial services like passports and housing, according to Nwagba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the government&#8217;s new system could boost banks&#8217; willingness to extend credits to regular customers, it could also be a win for fintechs as credit reporting will now be more transparent and consequence-flagged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nwagba urged financial institutions to commit to the national credit framework to close the country’s credit gap estimated at ₦183 trillion, which also requires private sector participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With the right infrastructure and transparency, lenders will be more confident, interest rates will drop, and Nigerians will finally have access to affordable credit,” Nwagba said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mark your calendars!  Moonshot by TechCabal is back in Lagos on October 15–16!

      "title": "Labour department denies racial quotas in Employment Equity Amendment Act",
      "description": "The Democratic Alliance, which has launched a court challenge to the amended Act, says it cannot have a place in democratic South Africa",
      "content": "<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The department of employment and labour has rejected claims by the Democratic Alliance (DA) that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202304/48418employment-equity-amendment-act42022.pdf\">Employment Equity Amendment Act</a>, which came into effect in January 2025,&nbsp; has sectoral racial quotas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, the DA <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/politics/2025-04-29-da-to-fight-employment-equity-law-in-court/\">said it had filed </a>an application in the Pretoria high court challenging the employment equity quotas in the Act which it says are merely “racial exclusion under a new name”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But labour department spokesperson Pertunia Lessing, told the <em>Mail &amp; Guardian</em> that the Act “does not have quotas”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DA, whose challenge will be heard in the coming weeks, says the new amendments will “make employers self-implement sectoral racial quotas”, which give employers the right to identify and record an employee’s race if the employee chooses not to disclose it voluntarily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a written reply to a DA question in parliament, Employment and Labour Minister&nbsp; Nomakhosazana Meth said the amendment was meant to ensure “reliable, existing historical data”. This would mean that an employee would either need to disclose their family history, which is considered personal information, or have their race assumed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DA spokesperson on labour Michael Bagraim said Meth’s “generic” definitions of persons of colour cannot stand in a democratic South Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a preposterous suggestion and appears to expect employers to conduct race inspections to tick a box, in order to avoid being fined,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Employment Equity Act, “black people” is a generic term that includes African, coloured and Indian people. This definition in the Act has not been amended since 1998.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the 2025 amendments, employers with 50 or more workers are required to ask each worker to fill out a form to declare their occupational level in terms of race,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>gender and disability status information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an employee refuses to fill out the form or gives incorrect details, the employer is allowed to use reliable past or current information to determine the person’s race, gender or disability status. This process must be done at the workplace and is the employer’s legal duty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DA accused the minister of not conducting a formal investigation based on evidence to establish the <a href=\"https://ee.labour.gov.za/DMISO/Employment%20Equity%20Regulations.pdf\">employment equity regulations</a>, saying this would push the country&#8217;s already high unemployment rate — officially at 32.9% — even higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“South Africa continues to be one of the most unequal nations on Earth, with more than eight million South Africans unemployed and a small elite enriched, making the evidence against employment equity regulations undeniable,” Bagraim said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Act as amended further sets hiring quotas for 18 economic sectors, from mining and transport to construction and agriculture, in a bid to increase employment opportunities for “designated groups” including black people, women and people living with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DA noted that South Africa no longer uses the Population Registration Act, an <a href=\"https://www.gov.za/documents/population-registration-act-repeal-act-11-may-2015-0922\">apartheid era law</a> that required every citizen to be classified by race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It cannot stand that employers become racial classification agents,” Bagraim said.</p>",

      "description": "The spacious, luxurious interior stands out and, while the drive is very smooth, the sensitive calibration of the brakes and throttle can take some getting used to",
      "content": "<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The local SUV segment has become crowded but South Africans are not complaining.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our less-than-perfect roads have led to many of us looking for vehicles with higher ground clearance and, luckily, all the manufacturers are giving us their own little twist on SUVs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford reintroduced the Territory as its answer to the growing middle-sized SUV market. It is built in China and the thin, curved headlights resemble a few of the Chinese vehicles we see on the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t necessarily have the characteristics of a Ford on the exterior. While it misses the mark of the traditional rugged look that the brand is known for, its aim was to release an SUV that looked commanding, agile and responsive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Territory’s front end is framed coast-to-coast by an integrated grille and LED daytime running lights, creating a signature light effect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The back of the vehicle has tail lights that are also curved but separated by the branding in the middle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Altogether, the exterior has a more energetic and unique feel than the average Ford.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"2500territorytitanium1.8lecoboost7at141\" class=\"wp-image-674129\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2500TerritoryTitanium1.8LEcoBoost7AT141-1000x662.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The spacious interior is the highlight of the Ford Territory.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-very-light-gray-to-cyan-bluish-gray-gradient-background has-background\"><strong>The interior</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel this is where the Territory does its best work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It continues to divert away from the extreme rugged nature of Ford SUVs, but it feels refreshing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wooden finish underneath the very nice materials on the dashboard gives the interior an upmarket and modern feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the centre of the new Territory experience is a panoramic display that integrates a 12.3-inch high-definition digital instrument cluster paired to a 12.3-inch landscape infotainment touchscreen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This caps off the luxurious nature of the interior and brings it all together exceptionally well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Titanium variant comes standard with a huge panoramic moonroof that flows all the way to the back of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the aesthetics blend together well, the best part of the Ford Territory is the practicality of the interior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front passengers are treated to very large and comfortable seats and the back is as spacious as mid-sized SUVs come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the feedback I received from anyone who sat at the back of the vehicle — they were impressed at the amount of headroom and legroom that was offered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"2500territorytitanium1.8lecoboost7at099\" class=\"wp-image-674130\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2500TerritoryTitanium1.8LEcoBoost7AT099-1000x665.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The interior of the Ford Territory sports a premium feel.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-very-light-gray-to-cyan-bluish-gray-gradient-background has-background\"><strong>The drive</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ford Territory has a 1.8 litre EcoBoost engine that delivers 138kW of power and 318Nm of torque.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is more than sufficient for easy overtakes on the highway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also provides a smooth drive. The engine is refined and there’s not much wind noise in the cabin. The handling and suspension also felt sturdy and solid, making navigating up steep hills effortless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Territory felt comfortable to drive — until I hit traffic on the N3. That’s when I started noticing the sensitive calibration of the brakes and throttle. The jerk I felt every time I applied the brakes became annoying.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will get used to it, but it is certainly not ideal, and it detracts from what is otherwise a splendid driving experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford has claimed 7 litres/100km on the Territory but I could only manage 8.3 litres/100km when I had the vehicle on test.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"2500territorytitanium1.8lecoboost7at049\" class=\"wp-image-674131\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2500TerritoryTitanium1.8LEcoBoost7AT049-1000x665.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-very-light-gray-to-cyan-bluish-gray-gradient-background has-background\"><strong>Safety</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the safety front, all Territory models are equipped with electronic stability control with traction control; emergency brake assist and electronic brakeforce distribution; hill launch assist; hill descent control and a tyre pressure monitoring system.

      "description": "The DA leader’s  interest in the position has sent political parties scrambling to find stronger candidates as the 2026 municipal elections loom",
      "content": "<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The possible return of Helen Zille to the political front line as the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) mayoral candidate in Johannesburg has set off a ripple effect across the city’s political organisations, prompting opposition parties and the ANC to reassess their own leadership offerings ahead of the 2026 local government elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the DA deliberates on whom to formally place as its mayoral candidate, senior party officials from the other parties including the ANC have expressed worry that Zille being in the mix would force them to change their election strategy and field stronger candidates to challenge her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zille, the DA federal council chair, a former mayor of Cape Town and former Western Cape premier, remains one of the DA’s most recognisable political figures and is credited with building the party’s administrative credibility during her leadership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her entry into the race would dramatically reshape the political terrain in a city that has been plagued by leadership turnover, coalition fragility and deteriorating service delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the DA itself, Zille’s potential candidacy is not without internal debate. Some party members believe her leadership experience and administrative record make her the strongest available option to stabilise the city’s governance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others are concerned that her combative style and controversial public statements could alienate centrist voters or complicate future coalition negotiations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She brings a level of seriousness and experience that no one else in the party has right now,” a DA official said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But there’s a question about whether her style will attract the support the DA needs in the townships and the greater Johannesburg.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zille has confirmed her interest in the position and has told the Mail &amp; Guardian that she managed to apply for the position before the deadline last Friday, adding that she was confident that her application would be supported by internal structures who have canvassed her to enter the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2026 municipal elections are expected to be fiercely contested, particularly in Johannesburg, where no single party has secured an outright majority since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city’s role as the economic hub of the country makes it a battleground in the political contest for urban governance. With Zille&nbsp; entering the race, the mayoral contest is set to become a test for all political parties who have to field stronger candidates to challenge Zille.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ANC, which currently governs Johannesburg through a fragile coalition, is facing renewed scrutiny over its candidate, Dada Morero, whose political standing has been weakened by the recent disbandment of his regional executive structure after its term expired earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Johannesburg regional executive committee, which is chaired by Morero, is also being forced to find a stronger candidate to challenge Zille following the disbanding of his branch in June when its term expired. The expiration allows stronger contenders to put their names up for the regional elections, thereby also fighting for the mayoral position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morero’s brief first tenure as Johannesburg mayor in 2022 lasted less than a month and was marked by controversy. His current term, which began in August 2024, has also been precarious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A senior official in the ANC’s Greater Johannesburg region told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the party is under growing pressure to field a stronger candidate that can represent the party strongly, even in the face of a Zille challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re in a difficult position. The emergence of Zille forces us to think seriously about a stronger alternative. Morero has been strong, but we ask ourselves if he can withstand a challenge against Zille in a mayoral challenge. The problem is that he remains the strongest candidate in the region, unless they can&nbsp; deploy someone in the national leadership,” the regional leader said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the upcoming ANC regional conference, Morero will contest the chairperson position against his former deputy, Loyiso Masuku. For Masuku, a victory could bolster her chances of becoming the ANC’s preferred mayoral candidate for the 2026 local government elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city has seen at least six mayors since 2021, and the ANC’s ability to retain control has depended on fragile alliances with parties such as Al Jama-ah and the Patriotic Alliance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public criticism over poor service delivery, budget irregularities and persistent infrastructure failures has further eroded confidence in the party’s local leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ActionSA is also grappling with strategic questions about its mayoral candidacy. The party’s founder, Herman Mashaba, previously served as mayor under a DA-led coalition and remains its most recognisable figure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His departure from the DA in 2019 and subsequent formation of ActionSA allowed him to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the city’s governance. However, the party has since redirected its focus to national expansion, and internal debates have surfaced over whether Mashaba should be re-deployed to Johannesburg in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a senior ActionSA councillor, the prospect of a Zille candidacy has forced the party to consider its leadership options more urgently. “If she is selected by the DA, which we believe she will, we will need our biggest contenders including the president to run because he remains our strongest candidate in the city,” the councillor said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, early this month, Mashaba “shrugged off the claims” that he’s planning another run for Johannesburg’s mayoralty. He told EWN that ActionSA has not yet formally selected its mayoral candidates for key municipalities, and emphasised his intent to back other leaders within the party for now, effectively neither confirming nor denying a personal return to local politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For smaller parties that have gained influence in Johannesburg through coalition arrangements, the emergence of a high-profile DA candidate presents a new challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Patriotic Alliance, Al Jama-ah, and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have all played kingmaker roles in the city since 2021, using their positions to negotiate seats on the mayoral committee and other executive roles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Zille’s possible candidacy could polarise the electoral contest, pushing voters towards more defined choices and reducing the leverage of smaller parties in post-election negotiations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EFF, which has styled itself as the radical alternative to both the ANC and the DA, has not indicated whether it will field a mayoral candidate in Johannesburg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its electoral support in the city has remained relatively flat since 2016, and its role in coalition politics has been largely tactical. However, with the possibility of a high-profile DA candidate in the race, the party may be forced to clarify its position on executive leadership.</p>",

      "title": "Davido's 5IVE reviewed: triumph and tradeoffs for Nigerian superstar",
      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>Davido's latest album, <em>5IVE</em>, is more than a fifth chapter - it's a pivot. Infused with genre experimentation, lyrical depth, and a surprising penchant for numerology, <em>5IVE</em> is both an evolution and a mirror, reflecting not only Davido's personal journey but also the broader transformation - and occasional dilution - of 'Afrobeats' on the global stage.</p><p>The opening track, <em>Five by Alhanislam</em>, is less song than grandiose sermon. Delivered by spoken-word artist Maryam Bukar Hassan, the 1:11-minute monologue sets the stage with angel numbers and prophetic flair - all in service of the central theme: five.</p><p>With <em>Anything</em>, Davido balances faith and panache. \"No get time to sleep, leave pressure for the weak,\" he asserts, before likening himself to biblical David confronting Goliath. At his best, Davido isn't singing about cars or conquests, but conviction. That honesty threads through <em>Be There Still</em>, a gritty, grief-tinged tribute to his late three-year old son, where he confesses, \"the pain brings out the best in me.\" Here, he doesn't just tell a story - he bleeds it.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Peaks and troughs</h2><p>But not all that glitters is gospel. <em>Titanium</em>, his Chris Brown collaboration, lands like soggy toast - clichéd, sonically Westernised, and oddly divorced from any Nigerian musical DNA. It's a reminder that in chasing global streams, something deeply African can get lost in translation. Davido certainly isn't the only artist to fall victim to this, yet for someone once synonymous with hits like <em>Skelewu</em> and <em>If</em>, this polished blandness feels like a betrayal.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Davido project without a nod - or several - to romance. But here, quantity overwhelms quality. <em>Offa Me</em> with Victoria Monét is a limp call-and-response that neither smoulders nor soothes. <em>Lover Boy</em>, despite featuring Francophone icons Tayc and Dadju, disintegrates under cringeworthy lyrics like \"I got so many girls in my area,\" resembling a forgotten SoundCloud demo more than grown songwriting.</p><p>Still, <em>5IVE</em> has its peaks. <em>Lately</em> and <em>With You</em> offer welcome returns to Davido's Nigerian core - raw, reflective, and steeped in spiritual overtones - the essence of David Adedeji Adeleke beneath the superstar veneer. Omah Lay's animated performance and silky vocals in <em>With You</em> all but carry the album, while Davido wisely opts for a more grounded delivery.</p><p>And then there's <em>10 Kilo</em>, the chicken metaphor we didn't know we needed. Playing on Nigerian market slang, the track is a flirty ode to plus-sized confidence, one of the album's few genuinely light-hearted moments that still lands.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Identity crisis</h2><p>But here's the catch: despite its merits, <em>5IVE</em> feels at times like a stylistic identity crisis. It wants to be everything - Afrobeats, Amapiano, R&amp;B, 3-Step - and in the process, often becomes nothing in particular. Davido himself has acknowledged this tension, noting in interviews that each project must \"please the Western world and make money for the label,\" but also \"please our original fans\".</p><p>This is evident on the tenth track, <em>Holy Water</em> featuring Victony, which attempts to baptise the listener in spirituality but slips on its own contradictions. Between sultry double-entendres and casual swearing, it feels more Saturday night than Sunday morning. Yet a first-place ranking on the Nigeria Official Top 100 Albums proves Davido knows how to sell a narrative, if not always a cohesive album.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>5IVE</em> is both a triumph and a trade-off. It's a tale of a man who's mourning, maturing, and monetising - sometimes all in one verse. Whether it's the nostalgia, success, or rhythm that drew you in, know this: the Afrobeat juggernaut may not be slaying Goliath this time, but he's still very much in the fight.</p>",

      "title": "Trump invites China to make itself at home in Africa",
      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump's Africa 'strategy' has been even more short-sighted and tin-earned than his most trenchant critics might have feared.</p><p>Never one to show much of an interest in the continent, Trump appears to have veered from the apathy of his first term - when he didn't visit a single African country - to outright hostility.</p><p>In June, Trump banned citizens from seven African countries from travelling to the United States. In a rambling speech, citing risks from terrorism and a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, as well as the prevalence of visa overstays, Trump justified the exclusion of citizens of Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan. Partial restrictions have also been imposed on citizens from Burundi, Sierra Leone and Togo.</p><p>The proclamation followed just weeks after the degrading spectacle of Trump's Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who he ambushed in front of the international media with a cynically-edited video recycling discredited allegations of the mass killing of white farmers.</p><p>That shameful, unbecoming performance was the latest incident in the spiralling relations between the countries under Trump, who has already expelled the South African ambassador and railed repeatedly against the country on his so-called 'Truth Social' platform.</p><p>That's not all. In April, Trump slapped tariffs on scores of African countries as part of his 'Liberation Day' overhaul of US trade relations - with the hardest-hit nations being Lesotho, whose goods will be hit with a tariff of 50%; Madagascar (47%); and Mauritius (40%). Just a few of the other hard hit countries are Botswana (37%); Angola (32%) South Africa (30%); Libya (31%); Algeria (30%); and Tunisia (28%). </p><p>Those and other tariffs have been reduced to a 10% universal levy for three months pending further negotiations, but the damage to trade is already clear. The long established but soon to lapse African Growth and Opportunity Act, which provides African manufacturers with tariff-free access to the US, is likely to join development agency USAID - also dismantled by Trump - in the dustbin of history. </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">China spies an opportunity</h2><p>At the same time as Trump is taking a wrecking ball to diplomatic and economic relations, arch-foe China is recalibrating its Africa strategy. In mid-June, Beijing announced plans to eliminate all tariffs on imports from 53 African sovereign states with which it maintains diplomatic ties. Eswatini, the only African nation that recognises Taiwan's sovereignty, is the only exception. Africa's most underdeveloped economies, which already gained full access to the Chinese market last year, have been promised additional assistance to boost their exports. In a thinly-veiled barb at Trump, the agreement \"call(s) on all countries, the United States in particular, to return to the right track of resolving trade disputes through consultation based on equality, respect and mutual benefit\".</p><p>China is evidently looking to displace the US in the few markets where America is still the trading partner of choice - these include Lesotho, Mauritius, Morocco, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya. China already reigns supreme as an export destination for goods from the DRC, Angola, Zambia and others. Some data suggests that the countries are already tied when it comes to annual FDI flows, even as China has had to reduce its investment in Africa in recent years as it wards off domestic economic pressures. </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make yourselves comfortable</h2><p>Quite what Trump's malice towards African partners is supposed to achieve is anyone's guess. </p><p>But with the US president's flickering attention span now dominated by the Israel-Iran war, as well as his stuttering attempt to bring peace to Russia and Ukraine, it is hard to see how Africa will figure positively in his plans. Indeed, he is virtually opening the door for China, and inviting them to walk right in and get comfortable.<br /></p>",

      "title": "Egypt stops Global March on Gaza in its tracks",
      "description": "The march ended an hour outside of Cairo when we were bussed back to the city",
      "content": "<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The day started with fear and uncertainty. We had arrived in Cairo two days before amid rumours of detentions, assaults, and deportations. A former colleague of mine had warned, “Watch your back, the authorities are hectic.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in Egypt to join the Global March on Gaza scheduled for Friday  13 June. About 4  000 activists from more than 80 countries had responded to the call to go to the border of Egypt and Gaza, set up a camp and demand the opening of humanitarian corridors into Gaza and an end to the siege.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea was to meet in Cairo, board a convoy of buses and to travel to the town of el-Arish in the Sinai Peninsula. Carrying rucksacks, sleeping bags and tents, the participants would then march 45 kilometres on foot to the Rafah border.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriving in Cairo as tourists, we would be informed where the pick-up points for the buses would be. We had also been informed that the Egyptian authorities had been approached for permission to proceed to el-Arish. Even before leaving South Africa, we had heard that people were being turned back at the airport in Cairo or that some who had cleared customs were being rounded up and deported.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The atmosphere was reminiscent of those old spy movies set in the Eastern Bloc. “Be careful who you speak to, try not to attract any attention, don’t venture out on your own, beware, even the walls have ears.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stories of the notoriety of Egyptian prison conditions and the “disappearance” of people were rife. There were also stories of people who had been attacked by locals opposed to our presence. And above all, that the march would not be allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we spent Thursday night huddled in our hotels like fugitives. Surreptitiously we were instructed to be ready to leave at 7am. Directions to the pick-up points would be issued just before we leave the hotel. Later on, the departure time was changed to 12.30.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the reception area our cohort was informed of a further change in plans. For security reasons we would no longer be travelling by bus. We needed to divide ourselves into groups of three and call for a taxi or an Uber and head off to an address provided. We were instructed to leave the hotel one group at a time, to be followed by the next, only if the previous group had informed the others that they were in their respective vehicles and on their way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We (myself and two other South Africans) were the first to leave. With rucksacks on our backs and the best wishes of our fellow travellers, we stepped into the blinding midday sunlight and made our way to the street corner where our Uber would pick us up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muhammed, our driver, a pleasant affable chap, offered us a cigarette, as we set off on the highway out of Cairo. About an hour out of Cairo we reached the Kamphashir toll station. It was chaos. Cars, tourist buses and minicabs were being held up by dozens and dozens of law enforcement types, some in uniforms, others in plain clothes, all of them armed. There was also a military presence. People were being asked for their passports and told to step out of their vehicles and wait on the side of the road.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid it all, we concocted a story that we were heading to a youth hostel just beyond the toll gate to spend a few days at the ocean. After handing over our passports and having our phones scrutinised, we were told to join the masses on the side of the road. Nobody seemed to know what was going on except that it was quite obvious that the authorities were onto us. We speculated that we would probably be forced onto the police transport vehicles and either taken directly to the airport to be deported or, worse, taken to a detention centre.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the organisers tried to negotiate our safe passage to continue. After about an hour the authorities offered back our passports on condition that we returned to Cairo. And because most of the taxis and Uber drivers had understandably left the scene, we would have to make use of the transport provided by the police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;A few “delegates” took up the offer but the majority of the roughly 250 people chose to stay put, determined to continue on our mission. The decision was also taken that if we were not allowed to proceed then we would set up camp right there on the side of the road. The rejection of the offer seemed to infuriate the officers present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After almost three hours in the scorching heat, we were penned in a confined space and told to wait as more military and crowd control vehicles rolled up. Men armed with Kalashnikovs and other weaponry surrounded us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Img 20250613 140616\" class=\"wp-image-674122\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_20250613_140616-1000x750.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">About 4 000 people from about 80 countries met in Cairo  and had planned to walk 45km from el-Arish in Egypt’s North Sanai Governorate to Rafah on the southern border of the Gaza Strip. But they were stopped before even reaching the border.

There were activists from around the world, sharing what food and water that they had. Young people chanting the now universally known slogans in support of Palestine. A small group of Turkish musicians, playing traditional instruments and singing soulful songs, kept us entertained. Despite the oppressive heat, our spirits were high, united in our determination not to be moved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, unannounced, a bunch of large burly men, bouncer types, descended on us. Senior activists advised the group to sit down, remain calm, interlock our arms and offer no resistance. In the face of barked commands and threats, a group of young people started singing freedom songs in support of Palestine. On command, the men suddenly started grabbing at those on the fringes. Any resistance was met by hard body blows and kicks. Some people also suffered baton blows to the body. In the ensuing panic we were forced to board the buses. Still shook up, I realised I was on the wrong bus. In the bus alongside singing broke out and the young people were rocking again, undaunted by the threats of violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were kept waiting on the buses until our passports were returned to each of us. In the dark we headed back to Cairo. And then on the outskirts of Cairo we were unceremoniously dropped off, two or three at a time, at random intervals. Still shook up we made our way back to the hotel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I reflected on the day, I realised we had won. We were not cowered. We did not make it to Rafah but we did not capitulate. Our demand for the humanitarian aid corridors to Gaza to be opened and an end to the siege remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jimi Matthews is a writer, photographer, editor, cameraman and producer.

      "description": "More men than women take their own lives, murder rate of men is also higher, men take the lives of others and gender-based violence is rife",
      "content": "<p>June is men’s mental health month in South Africa. The purpose is to encourage men to seek health services by promoting physical and psychological wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported suicide as the fourth highest cause of death among men aged 15 to 24 in South Africa. Further, suicide rates are significantly higher among men than women, with 10 861 of the 13 774 suicides reported in 2023 being by men. A number of parasuicides is unrecorded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research and practice demonstrate a correlational and causal relationship between the persistence of social ills and the prevalence of mental health conditions, compounded by poor services. Research also shows that young men are more at risk of substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other externalising mental health conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no evidence to prove there is a link between young people who have died by suicide and are not at institutions of higher learning and training or employed. But there is evidence that proves a close and causal relationship between social ills and mental health. One would assume this is also the case with suicide as a symptom of mental illness such as depression and substance abuse for example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This takes us to the intersection of these issues, the state of young men in our society, masculinity and mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, we learnt of the increase in youth unemployment for the first quarter of 2025. According to Statistics South Africa, 62.4% of young people aged 15 to 24 are unemployed. Further, the University of Cape Town’s Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit reported that 30% of young people have not been in education, employment or training for the past decade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are not just statistics, these are people with dreams and aspirations. They are our family, friends, neighbours, and we see them every day. They are each and everyone of us. They are the antithesis to President Ramaphosa’s Tintswalo. I wish we had more Tintswalos, Mr President. I wish it was the rule and not the exception.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other aspect of this calamity of unemployment are the psychological ramifications. Social issues such as gender-based violence, intimate partner violence, mass murder and the pervasive violence in our society are to an extent a reflection of our society. While we call for the criminal justice system to act in persecuting offenders, we must equally ask ourselves critical questions about men and masculinity in our society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to do serious introspection and reflection on the society we are building, and the kind of men and manhood it produces. Something is fundamentally wrong in our society. As a psychologist, I have seen this in the gender disparity in the patients I work with on a daily basis. The people who should be in the room are often not there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feminist scholar, bell hooks, teaches that regressive forms of masculinity require that men suppress the emotional aspect of themselves, and if they do not do so, other men will. This is evident in state approaches to substance use, violence and crime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the family as the basic unit of society, questions are to be asked about the home circumstances under which children grow up in. What conversations are had in our homes about mental health, health seeking behaviour, emotional wellness, consent, sexuality and masculinity?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, we must also ask about fathering and fathers in our society. Where do boys learn to be men? The State of South African Fathers report would be an important point of departure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What role does social media and technology play in shaping manhood and masculinity? In a period of pervasive manosphere, how do we influence what our children, young men and men in general see as expressions of manhood and masculinity?&nbsp; What are the hegemonic narratives on manhood and masculinity?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One may ask: why focus on men when they cause so much harm and pain in our society?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Africa has one of the highest femicide rates globally, with about seven women to have been murdered daily. We also have one of the highest gender-based violence rates and other forms of violence against women and children.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally, our country has one of the highest murder rates, with men being the victim in about 70% of the cases — and it is usually men who are the perpetrators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, we have a masculinity problem in our society, and we cannot continue to treat it only as a legal and policing problem. It requires all of us to act, to play a role in shaping the lives of young men. In our homes, neighbourhood, schools, sports fields, churches and all other facets of life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Argentine social psychologist, Isaacs Prilleltensky, challenges us to build conducive social conditions of justice as a prerequisite for wellness, without which wellness becomes impossible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mental health practitioners, we carry a social responsibility to respond to social issues. In collaboration with communities, organisations and other institutions. We all ought to collectively labour towards a just and free society, and this includes our different professions being rooted at the core of our communities and being agents of change.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Siphelele Nguse is a clinical psychologist, scholar activist, and PhD candidate at Stellenbosch University.</strong></p>",

      "title": "Don’t call asylum seekers and refugees makwerekwere; make them feel at home",
      "description": "Talk to people to understand why they fled their home county and the difficulties they face in South Africa",
      "content": "<p>World Refugee Day is observed annually on 20 June to honour the courage and strength of people who have been forced to escape their home country by conflict or persecution. According to the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/events/world-refugee-day-2025\">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,</a> this year’s World Refugee Day calls for us to reflect on how we can stand in solidarity with refugees and asylum seekers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In South Africa, refugees and asylum seekers, like many around the world, seek safety and an opportunity to rebuild their lives after escaping violence, conflict and persecution from their countries of origin. But many continue to face ongoing difficulties, including xenophobia and limited opportunities to earn an income. These difficulties are often worsened by delays or obstacles in <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/thought-leader/opinion/2024-07-11-refugees-are-not-migrants-but-people-forced-to-flee-their-home-countries/\">renewing legal documentation</a>, which is essential for living, working, and pursuing tertiary education in South Africa. Such barriers not only exacerbate their trauma but also prolong their healing process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than<a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/where-we-work/countries/south-africa\"> 250&nbsp;000</a> refugees living in the country, how can we as individuals and communities stand with them in solidarity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we should have discussions with refugees and asylum seekers<em>. </em>It is essential to better understand their experiences of living in the country and the types of support they need to rebuild their lives effectively. In my experience, many are willing to speak openly and share their stories when given a safe space to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, we should make refugees and asylum seekers feel welcome. They are often called “makwerekwere”, a derogatory term used by some to inform foreign nationals from African countries that they are outsiders who are not welcome. Instead of looking at refugees and asylum seekers as outsiders, we need to focus on how we can make South Africa a place of safety and dignity, where they can rebuild their lives and feel at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to achieve this is by running community-based programmes in areas where refugees and asylum seekers live. These programmes can raise awareness about who refugees are, why they are in communities and how local residents can partner with them to build stronger and more inclusive communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such platforms also allow refugees and asylum seekers to tell their stories. This will help locals to understand the context of their journeys and the reasons they have sought refuge in South Africa. Being given a voice also empowers refugees and asylum seekers to participate in community life and build mutual understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many refugees are skilled professionals (lawyers, healthcare professionals, teachers, and more) who bring valuable experience and expertise that can benefit South African society. Embracing their contributions is a step toward building more inclusive and safe communities for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, we should teach children to respect and accept refugees and asylum seekers<em>. </em>Through my work with refugee and asylum-seeking children in mental health services and research, one recurring problem they face is bullying often because of their skin tone or accent. It is important to teach local children respect, empathy, and inclusion. School-based programmes and initiatives can encourage South African learners to see refugees and asylum seekers as equals, and not to mock, isolate,or bully them for being different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://traumacentre.org.za/\">The Trauma Centre for Survivors of Violence and Torture</a> held workshops to bring together South African adolescents and refugee and asylum-seeker adolescents. These sessions created a space for honest conversation and understanding. By the end of the workshops, South African adolescents said the workshops helped them to develop compassion and awareness about the plight of refugees and asylum seekers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fourth, we should support organisations that provide services to refugees and asylum seekers<em>. </em>In recent years, organisations worldwide offering essential services to them have had severe funding cuts, further reducing already limited services to this marginalised population. For example, in South Africa, the Adonis Musati Project, which was founded in 2007 and offered skills training, youth programmes and psychosocial support, had to close because of a lack of funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations such as the Trauma Centre and <a href=\"https://www.scalabrini.org.za/\">Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town</a> continue to offer vital services to refugees and asylum seekers but they rely on external financial support. Individuals and businesses can help these organisations by providing financial support, paying school fees and donating food, toiletries, clothes and other essentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last, we should prioritise multi-stakeholder intervention. It is also important for civil society, and government departments (such as health, education and the police) to collaborate in finding solutions to address the problems refugees and asylum seekers face. Ensuring access to basic needs like education and healthcare, as well as support services such as local language programmes and income-generating opportunities, is critical to promoting the effective settlement and integration of refugees and asylum seekers in South Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standing in solidarity with refugees and asylum seekers in South Africa requires us all to play our part. The country is known around the world for its philosophy of ubuntu, which means “am because we are”. For the nation to fully reflect its spirit of ubuntu and show humanity towards others, all who live in the country must extend compassion, understanding and support to refugees and asylum seekers as they work to rebuild their lives<strong> </strong>and heal from traumatic experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yeukai Chideya is a researcher at the Institute for Life Course Health Research at Stellenbosch University.</strong></p>",

      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>MOPO, a British company that rents out portable batteries and recharges the devices at solar-powered hubs, has received a strategic investment from energy giant Octopus as it looks to scale-up its activities in Africa.</p><p>The company began its operations in Sierra Leone in 2017. It has since expanded to other markets including Nigeria, DR Congo and Liberia, delivering some 25 million battery rentals on a pay-per-use basis. Octopus is the second major player to invest in MOPO this year, after BII, the UK's development finance institution, invested $7m in January with the goal of accelerating the rollout of MOPO's services in DR Congo.</p><p>In a statement, Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy Group, said that the investment would allow the two companies to \"make a big leap forward\" in bringing electricity to the 600m people in Africa who currently lack access.</p><p>Luke Burras, MOPO's chief operating officer told <em>African Business</em> that the battery rental approach pioneered by the company can succeed in parts of Africa where mini-grids and solar home systems have struggled to be financially viable.</p><p>\"The reason that grid electrification and mini-grid electrification isn't working is because there's a misalignment between customer usage patterns and operator capex costs,\" he says. </p><p>He notes that solar mini-grids are good at delivering electricity during the sunny daytime hours, but operators need to invest in expensive battery storage systems to meet demand peaks in the evening. The result is that customers \"are not at all incentivised to be careful\" around how and when they use power.</p><p>Burras adds that solar home systems also have major limitations across much of Africa, given that the typical customer cannot take on the debt needed to install such a system. Some companies have experimented with leasing solar systems, but Burras says that these companies often struggle to keep growing unless they take on \"bad customers\" who fail to pay their bills.</p><p>MOPO believes that leasing batteries could be a flexible solution that is tailored to the realities of the market in countries like Sierra Leone. </p><p>\"We knew that we needed to produce an energy solution that matched customers' willingness and ability to pay,\" adds Burras. </p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rethinking mini-grids</h2><p>MOPO currently offers two models: a small 50Wh device that allows low-income customers to use power for tasks such as lighting and phone charging; and the 1kWh MOPOMax, which are intended to replace petrol generators.</p><p>\"A typical user goes all the way from somebody who has very low access to electricity and might rent one MOPO battery once a month to charge their phone,\" says Burras, \"all the way to in Kinshasa, a MOPOMax customer who's renting four or five giant MOPOMax batteries every day to run their printing business or their fridge ice-making business for fisheries.\"</p><p>Customers pick-up the batteries from MOPO's hubs, where a small array of rooftop solar panels charges and recharges the devices. A network of local agents are responsible for renting out the batteries and ensuring that customers return the devices on time.</p><p>Burras says that MOPO is working on several plans to expand its offerings. One project is aimed at customers in areas where some grid power is typically available, but only for a few hours a day. Customers would be able to keep MOPO batteries with a two-way inverter at home for long periods, or even indefinitely, and could charge their batteries when grid power is switched on.</p><p>MOPO also hopes to launch its own version of mini-grids. Centralised generating units, possibly at MOPO's existing hubs, would deliver electricity to local homes, where customers would recharge their batteries when solar power is available. Customers would be paying for storage in their own homes, rather than at central locations. \"We think that's got real, real capability to scale,\" says Burras.</p><p>MOPO currently employs around 1,200 people, mostly as agents, and no longer has expatriates working on the ground in Africa. But Burras says MOPO is likely to continue relying on Chinese partners for manufacturing. Its CEO Chris Longbottom has relocated to China to oversee the development of new product offerings.</p><p>The idea of manufacturing MOPO hardware in Africa remains a distant prospect, Burras acknowledges. \"It's not a focus for us,\" he says, adding \"a lot of development would need to take place,\" before Africa could hope to match the capabilities of industrial agglomerations in China.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Octopus Energy launches energy fund with $250m ambition</h2><p>Octopus Energy has launched its first African energy fund which will target renewable energy sectors. The Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund plans to invest in clean energy solutions including rooftop solar, battery storage, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and grid upgrades in order to \"power communities and businesses with affordable, homegrown, green energy.\"</p><p>The fund is launched with an initial $60m and has ambitions to mobilise $250m over the next three years. As part of the move, Octopus Energy Generation is working with African investment specialist Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Managers to create a \"smart, practical model that opens new doors for green investments in emerging markets\". </p><p>Zoisa North-Bond, CEO at Octopus Energy Generation, said: \"Africa is abundant with clean energy potential - enough to build the next-generation renewable powerhouse and a greener, fairer future fuelled by sunshine and wind. By partnering with local experts, such as Pembani Remgro Infrastructure Managers, we aim to accelerate that future and create new green pathways.\"<br /><br /></p>",

      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>Ahead of its 25th Annual General Meeting in Luanda, Angola, the African Trade and Insurance Agency, now rebranded as the African Trade and Investment Development Insurance (ATIDI) has affirmed its commitment to facilitating investment and growth in Africa by ATIDI, highlighted its commitment to the continent and the advantages, as highlighted by its activities in Angola, of being a shareholder through its ability to leverage its insurance capacity to raise capital at competitive rates.</p><p>Established in 2001 to encourage foreign direct investment into Africa by insuring political and commercial risks which have typically deterred investors from considering Africa, ATIDI has grown considerably. According to its latest financial statement, as of December 2024, the institution had a capital base of $791.5m, a 13% increase on the previous year and  intends to reach a billion dollar capital base in the next three years. These latest financials also show that ATIDI supported $8.9bn of trade and investment in 2024, spread across the continent. This impressive performance was achieved against a backdrop of  $1billion net exposure, highlighted ATIDI's ability to leverage its own capacity by mobilising reinsurance from regional and international insurance markets .</p><p>Speaking at the press briefing, Annabelle Buzingo, Senior Underwriter at ATIDI, said that it is able to support investments due to its strong rating and deep understanding of the African terrain. \"We have boots on the ground, with a presence in a number of countries in. We are present and we understand the risk. This is why we're able to provide cover for investors coming on the continent,\" she stressed.</p><p>Backed by 24 member states and 13 institutional investors including the African Development Bank and Africa Re as well as international shareholders, such as Chubb Limited, the Japanese export credit agency NEXI and India's export credit agency ECGC amongst others, ATIDI provides risk mitigation for debt and equity investments as well as trade transactions across Africa.</p><p>Coverage includes political and investment risks such as currency inconvertibility, war, expropriation, nationalisation, sovereign and sub-sovereign non-payment, civil unrest and the risk of arbitral award default. In addition, ATIDI offers protection against commercial risks including insolvency and prolonged default. To support infrastructure and construction projects, the institution provides cover for performance-related risks, including bid bonds and performance guarantees. ATIDI has also successfully rolled out a liquidity instrument, the Regional Liquidity Support Facility (RLSF), which protects renewable energy independent power producers from short-term payment delays from utilities and facilitates bankability in the sector.</p><p>In Angola, ATIDI has provided over $1.5bn in risk coverage across key sectors including water, energy and gas and construction. \"Together with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development at the World Bank, and later BPI France, we secured financing for the Bita Water project of $1.1bn . We have also recently raised $200m to cover the rehabilitation of the Estrada Nacional [road project],\" Buzingo recounted. The financing for the Bita Water project had a longer tenor and was priced at more than 500 basis points lower than the yield the country was paying at the time on international markets.</p><p>Noting that ATIDI has wide developmental impacts, Buzingo called for ATIDI shareholders to respect its Preferred Creditor Status. \"It is the reason we are able to deliver leverage on our capital and impactful projects and transactions in Africa,\" she explained.</p><p>Benjamin Mugisha, ATIDI's Chief Underwriting Officer, reiterated the institution's commitment to the Angolan economy, including through a portfolio product for SMEs. \"African businesses are predominantly SMEs, so we will be talking to local banks to see how we can help them to develop even more support for SMEs. This is because the backbone of African economies will be Africans themselves and so it's very important to help those SMEs,\" he said.</p><p>Mugisha added that ATIDI is keen to support not just inward flows of investment but also trade between African countries and the outside world. Through its SME programme and other private sector initiatives, ATIDI hopes to make financing available to private sector companies. \"So with these mechanisms and of course, with many other partners in this space, we hope we can help to address some of the systemic challenges that we have on the continent,\" he asserted.  Asked how ATIDI balanced developmental priorities and also profits, Mugisha said that any institution needs to be sustainable and profitability is a testament to the organisation fulfilling its founders' vision in a sustainable way. With a strong capital base, ATIDI will be able to continue to grow and sustainably support its clients across the continent.</p>",

      "title": "Amid funding squeeze, Africa urged to pursue self-reliance",
      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>Calls for Africa to strengthen its economic self-reliance and develop using its own capital intensified at the African Development Bank (AfDB) annual meetings in Abidjan, where more than 6000 delegates assembled for five days of meetings and discussions on Africa's development landscape. Africa is grappling with a significant development funding squeeze amid drastic cuts to foreign aid by western nations.</p><p>On top of dismantling USAID and freezing billions of dollars in foreign aid, Washington is reconsidering a $555m development finance commitment to the AfDB. European nations have also slashed overseas development assistance budgets in recent months, adding to the financial strain facing African countries that heavily rely on foreign aid to fund government programmes in education, healthcare and infrastructure.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No free lunch</h2><p>The question of how Africa can navigate this challenging funding environment hung heavy in the air during the course of the annual meetings. Leaders and experts who spoke stressed that the time was nigh for Africa to shift its attention to domestic and alternative sources of capital. Africa, they argued, must harness its own capital - natural, human, and financial - to drive a new era of economic self-reliance.</p><p>\"We can't keep waiting for outsiders. Our roads, schools, and jobs should be built with our own capital. It's time to invest in ourselves,\" President Alassane Ouattara of Côte d'Ivoire said during the official opening ceremony.</p><p>John Mahama, president of Ghana, urged African leaders to view self-reliance as a strategic imperative in view of ongoing geopolitical shifts around the globe. \"We've transitioned into a transactional world, which signals to Africa that we need to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps,\" he said.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the system is being amended and countries have decided to impose tariffs based on their own interest. It sends a signal to Africa that there is no free lunch anywhere,\" he added.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Untapped domestic resources</h2><p>The African Development Bank's <em>African Economic Outlook 2025</em> (AEO) report, launched during the AfDB annual meetings, contends that, with the right policies, Africa could mobilise an additional $1.43 trillion in domestic resources from tax and non-tax revenue sources. This exceeds Africa's estimated $1.3 trillion annual gap in financing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, the report notes.</p><p>Delving into some of the major reforms needed to harness the continent's untapped domestic resources, the report states that \"Africa must broaden its revenue base, curb resource leakages, formalise its vibrant informal sector, deepen domestic financial markets and enhance the efficiency of public spending as well as tap into the transformative power of the diaspora.\"</p><p>Speaking during the report's unveiling, Kevin Uramah, AfDB's chief economist and vice president, stressed that revenue leakages were a persistent challenge undermining the pace and scale of development across the continent.</p><p>Compared to $190.7bn of financial inflows that Africa received in 2022, approximately $587bn was lost from financial leakages, the AEO report highlights. Of this, around $90bn was lost to illicit financial flows, a further $275bn was siphoned away by multinational corporations shifting profits, and $148bn was lost to corruption.</p><p>\"There can be no substitute for sound macroeconomic policy management, quality institutions, good governance and the rule of law,\" Uramah said.</p><p>Even though the continent has broadly recovered from the shocks of recent years such as inflation and the Covid-19 pandemic, the macroeconomic situation remains fragile in some countries. Indeed, the AEO report notes that fifteen countries are experiencing double-digit inflation, while interest payments now consume 27.5% of government revenue across Africa, up from 19% in 2019.</p><p>Uramah argued that allocating more of Africa's own capital to fund its development would catalyse additional investment from global investors by demonstrating to them that locals have skin in the game.</p><p>\"When Africa allocates its own capital - human, natural, fiscal, business and financial - effectively, global capital will follow Africa's capital to accelerate investments in productive sectors in Africa,\" he said.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing in domestic institutional capital</h2><p>According to Frannie Léautier, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, leveraging Africa's domestic institutional capital - such as assets held by pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance firms - will require a relentless focus on innovation and extensive regulatory reform. She believes that there is scope for African pension funds, which held assets worth $455bn in 2024, to invest more heavily in low-income countries through the African Development Fund (ADF), which is the AfDB's concessional funding window. Pension funds cannot currently invest directly in the ADF.</p><p>\"The African Development Fund can only receive capital from member countries. There are some reforms that are currently underway to bring in capital from outside the traditional member countries. This could open the way for African pension funds to get more involved,\" she tells <em>African Business</em> on the sidelines of the AfDB annual meetings. She says that investing in the ADF presents African pension funds with an opportunity to earn \"double returns, because you get a return in boosting economic growth and jobs, but you also get your funds repaid\".</p><p>Léautier says that the ADF is presently leveraging innovative tools such as partial risk guarantees and private credit guarantees to de-risk the private sector and make projects more attractive to risk-averse investors. This can help attract investments from pension funds into projects and countries. Partial risk guarantees are designed to insulate private lenders against political and regulatory risks that may arise due to state-related entities failing to honour contractual obligations. Private credit guarantees, on the other hand, enhance the credit-worthiness of ADF countries and state-owned enterprises, enabling them to access commercial financing more competitively.</p><p>\"On the equity side, we have innovations like taking first loss in an equity structure. This is very good, in particular for pension funds, who have to pay for their members' retirement and must make sure that their investment is not lost.\"</p><p>\"When you have these kinds of structures, they [pension funds] become more comfortable to invest in private sector transactions,\" she says.</p><p>Stressing the ADF's role in \"paving the way for the private sector to invest and create jobs,\" she urges ADF member countries to scale up their contributions to the fund in its 17th replenishment. ADF is targeting $25bn in this current funding cycle - an ambitious increase from the record $8.9bn (including $429m for a new climate window) that was raised in the 16th cycle.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Innovative financing</h2><p>Kader Hassane, senior investment director at Africa50, tells <em>African Business</em> that the platform's innovative approach to financing has allowed it to mobilise institutional capital for infrastructure development in Africa. This includes tapping into African pension fund money through the Africa50 Infrastructure Acceleration Fund (IAF), a 12-year closed-ended private equity fund designed to mobilise large-scale institutional capital for infrastructure projects.</p><p>\"For the first time in Africa, we were able to launch an infrastructure fund and raise over $200m almost exclusively from African institutional investors,\" Hassane says. \"What we're hoping for is that this is a proof of concept. We have pension funds from Morocco, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, and even PIC [the Public Investment Corporation] from South Africa involved.\"</p><p>Sponsored by Africa50, IAF secured $222.5m in commitments from 16 African institutional investors in its first close in December 2023. It is aiming for $500m in total commitments and focuses on equity and quasi equity investments.</p><p>Some of the raised capital has already been deployed in a port project in Casablanca, Hassane says, noting that the goal is to build a strong pipeline of commercially viable projects with clear development impact. \"We must deploy properly and ensure a track record. Once African pension funds can see that you can make a return and at the same time develop your continent and invest in infrastructure, I am confident we are going to be able to raise a lot more money,\" he said.</p><p>Africa50 was founded by African governments and the AfDB in 2015. Hassane points out that \"a focused and innovative approach\" is what make Africa50 unique and able to leverage its balance sheet to catalyse billions in private investment in African infrastructure. \"Our capital base is not the largest (currently slightly over $895m) but we pride ourselves on having capitalised more than $8bn worth of portfolio projects\" he explains. \"In the last eight years we have turned over 29 projects in 28 different jurisdictions - quite a feat in the African context. Because we are smaller we tend to be more nimble and can address the niches of the market. This is really the DNA of Africa50. It is speed, efficiency and innovation in our delivery,\" he says.</p><p>He notes that four sectors currently dominate Africa50's portfolio: energy; transport; information and communications technology; and mid-stream gas. \"These sectors represent more than 85% of our portfolio. We have opened up a bit to include health and education.\"</p><p>Looking forward, Hassane argues that asset recycling is one of the ways Africa50 will seek to collaborate with governments to catalyse additional private investment in infrastructure amid funding constraints. He notes that Africa50 is championing asset recycling in a bid to help African governments optimise their resources and develop much-needed infrastructure without increasing public debt.</p><p>\"The process begins with governments identifying infrastructure projects that will attract private investors. The focus is on commercially viable, revenue-generating assets such as toll roads, airports, or power plants. Once the asset is operational, the government can grant a long-term concession to a private investor, such as Africa50, to operate and maintain the asset in exchange for an upfront payment.\"</p><p>The upfront payment unlocks immediate liquidity for the government, which can utilise the funds unlocked by the transaction to upgrade existing infrastructure or develop new assets. \"The government can take this money and develop new infrastructure, which we can again help them recycle. So it's about enabling governments to move faster, to close infrastructure gaps while preserving fiscal space,\" he says.</p><p>\"We have done it in Gambia with the Senegambia bridge. It cost the government $130m to build it and we are giving them $93m up front in two tranches,\" he notes.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bigger share of natural resource wealth</h2><p>According to the AEO report, Africa hosts 30% of global mineral reserves. With the right policies that enable Africa to stake a greater economic claim on its natural resources, the continent stands to capture over 10% of the projected $16 trillion in global revenues from key green minerals by 2030.</p><p>The continent's mining sector is presently dominated by foreign firms that mostly focus on the extraction and exportation of raw minerals, limiting the flow of natural resource wealth to local people. While global mining giants continue to dominate large-scale operations, local entrepreneurs running early-stage mining companies face significant hurdles scaling their businesses. This is primarily due to challenges in accessing domestic capital.</p><p>Most of the domestic capital in Africa is sitting in banks. However, commercial banks tend to shy away from local early-stage mining projects due to regulatory requirements and low risk appetite, experts argued at a panel focused on mobilising domestic capital for Africa's mining sector.</p><p>\"They [banks] are usually constrained by regulatory handcuffs. The regulators who oversee them or supervise them have set in place sectoral limits, setting conditions which makes it difficult for them to go into early stage projects in mining,\" said Adeniran Aderogba, CEO and president of Nigeria's Regional Maritime Development Bank.</p><p>He pointed out that commercial banks have lower risk appetite and often require collateral beyond the project itself, forcing entrepreneurs to put up personal assets such as their homes or other properties as security. Moreover, even when a firm qualifies for financing, banks usually offer loans for shorter durations, which is at odds with the long project life cycles typical of early-stage exploration.</p><p>Aderogba pointed out that, in response to the funding challenges faced by mining companies, development finance institutions (DFIs) have increasingly stepped in to fill the gap. \"We have seen Africa-focused DFIs beginning to focus on early-stage projects in the mining sector. They are establishing special facilities - what we call project preparation facilities - to tackle these challenges,\" he said.</p><p>He argued that governments could provide credit enhancement tools, such as sovereign guarantees and political risk insurance, to support early-stage mining projects.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harnessing the demographic boom</h2><p>Koffi N'Guessan, Ivorian minister of vocational training and apprenticeships, said that job creation for the youth was the key to transforming Africa's demographic boom into real economic and geopolitical strength.</p><p>\"Africa is poised to become a major global power, alongside China and India, due to its demographic potential. However, we must prioritise vocational and technical training to fully harness this demographic dividend,\" he said.</p><p>He highlighted an alarming trend: approximately 22.5% of young people aged 15 to 24 in Africa are unemployed with no education or training. Moreover, some 250m children and young people in low-income countries are not in school.</p><p>\"Youth can become a liability if robust training policies are not implemented - from nursery school through to university,\" he warned.</p><p>Mona Iddrisu, head of youth employment and skills at the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), tells <em>African Business</em> that there is an urgent need to strengthen \"industry-classroom linkages\". This, she adds, will help address a growing problem - many youth don't possess the skills demanded by employers despite many years spent in school.</p><p>\"The problem is that we focus too much on enrolment and give little attention to equipping youth with skills that are actually demanded by employers. We are not aligned to the labour market. Training today should not be about certification, but about upskilling and re-skilling,\" she says.</p><p>\"Reforming our education system and investing in labour information systems is a good long-term solution. In the medium term we should unify and expand our labour markets, ensuring the free movement of people within the continent.</p><p>\"In the shorter term we should think about upskilling and reskilling in productive sectors like agriculture, the creative economy, the digital economy and the care economy,\" she said.</p><p>Iddrisu warned that, when it comes to creating job opportunities for the youth, African leaders cannot afford delay or inaction. \"When you have frustrated, hungry, underemployed or unemployed idle youth, it's a recipe for disaster. We must be intentional about creating jobs for our young people.\"</p><p>She called on leaders in both the public and private sectors to make more room for the youth in decision-making roles where they can have a real influence on how resources are allocated.</p><p>\"Young people and especially women must be present at tables where money is discussed. We need to get young people where the money is. We need to grow youth incomes. It is urgent.\"</p><p></p>",

      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>The African Trade & Investment Development Insurance (ATIDI) is set to hold its 25<sup>th</sup> Annual General Meeting (AGM) from 18-21 June 2025 in Luanda, Angola, under the theme \"Turning Risk into Opportunity, Securing a Sustainable Future.\"</p><p>This year's AGM marks a significant milestone for ATIDI as it celebrates a quarter century of facilitating trade and investment across Africa. The gathering will bring together high-level representatives from more than the organization's 24 African member states, 13 institutional shareholders, development finance institutions and strategic partners to reflect on progress, strengthen partnerships and shape the organization's future.</p><p>Key milestones and highlights from ATIDI's 25-year journey include:</p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>USD88+ billion in trade and investment supported across the continent</li>\n\n<li>Operations in 24 African member states, backed by global financial partners</li>\n\n<li>Named DFI of the Year at the 2025 African Banker Awards in Abidjan</li>\n\n<li>Significant growth in capital and product offerings</li>\n\n<li>Maintained its investment grade credit rating</li></ul><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quote from Manuel Moses, Chief Executive Officer, ATIDI</strong></h2><p>\"Over the past 25 years, ATIDI has evolved from a visionary concept into a leading force in Africa's development landscape, facilitating over USD88 billion in trade and investment. Guided by our mission to turn African risk into opportunity, we continue to rethink risk and deliver innovative insurance and financial solutions in partnership with the public and private sectors. Our impact is grounded in a commitment to driving resilient, inclusive and forward-looking growth across the continent.\"</p><p>ATIDI remains committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, scaling its impact through initiatives such as the Regional Liquidity Support Facility (RLSF). This flagship product supports renewable energy projects and strengthens energy security across Africa. To date, nine projects have been supported under RLSF in four countries, representing 181.95 MW of clean energy and mobilizing over USD 323.7 million in financing.</p><p>Late last year, ATIDI also announced a strategic partnership with Germany's KfW Development Bank to boost SME financing across Africa and improve cross-border trade efficiency through risk mitigation, training, and enhanced support for the COMESA Regional Customs Transit Guarantee (RCTG) Scheme. It simplifies the transit process by using a single guarantee for goods moving through African borders with the support of risk mitigation guarantees jointly structured by ATIDI, Africa-Re, Afreximbank, COMESA and ZEP-RE. This eliminates the need for separate guarantees in each country, reducing administrative burdens and delays for transporters, an essential pillar to materialize the visitation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quote from Benjamin Mugisha, Chief Underwriting officer, ATIDI</strong></h2><p>\"Sustainability is not a side objective; it is central to our mandate. We are proud to support the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the SDGs through investments that promote climate resilience, social inclusion, and long-term economic growth.\"</p><p>The AGM will feature high-level strategic dialogues, presentations of ATIDI's 2024 results, member updates, an Investor Roundtable and a Boardroom session that allows our shareholders to present their latest strategic objectives to the market, along with the approval of new accessions and initiatives. Angola's hosting of this milestone edition underscores its growing role in shaping regional integration and investment dialogue on the continent. Angola became a member state of ATIDI in 2023, and ATIDI has already supported infrastructure development of over USD2 billion for water supply, energy & gas and other infrastructure. These projects improve the quality of life, create jobs and improve livelihoods which is at the heart of ATIDI's mandate.</p><p>ATIDI's AGM is a sign of recognition to the Republic of Angola's chairmanship of the African Union and an acknowledgement of the country's leadership and convening power.</p>",

      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) has partnered with the African Women Leaders Network (AWLN) to promote financial inclusion for women entrepreneurs on the continent. The two organisations, which signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the sidelines of the African Development Bank (AfDB) annual meetings in Abidjan, pledged to work together to boost access to capital for women-led and women-owned businesses in Africa.</p><p>BADEA and AWLN also agreed to consolidate their efforts to advocate for greater representation of women in corporate boardrooms, management positions, and key decision-making roles.</p><p>\"This partnership... opens the door to new strategic alliances aimed at amplifying the Network's impact across the continent,\" AWLN said in a statement.</p><p>Launched in 2017 under the aegis of the African Union Commission (AUC) and the United Nations (UN), AWLN is a network of accomplished women leaders in Africa drawn from the political, business, academia, science, community and general leadership arenas.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timely partnership</h2><p>Bineta Diop, AU special envoy on women, peace and security and AWLN co-convener, welcomed the partnership with BADEA. She said that the move was aligned with the network's mission to \"empower women with resources and decision-making power. AWLN, through its Private Sector Coalition and African Women Impact Fund, works to reduce disparities by forming partnerships, securing funding, and building alliances that empower women with resources and decision-making power.\"</p><p>She noted that the focus on financial inclusion was particularly timely in light of the significant gap in access to formal financial services that many African women entrepreneurs grapple with.</p><p>\"Financial inclusion for women in Africa continues to be a significant obstacle,\" Diop said. \"According to ACET [African Centre for Economic Transformation], women make up 58% of Africa's active workforce, yet only 30% have access to formal financial services. The financial inclusion of women is a vital economic growth strategy.\"</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more women on boards</h2><p>Diop urged business leaders and decision makers in the private sector to make more space for women in leadership. </p><p>\"We still have low representation of women on boards and management. We are still below 10% in Africa.\"</p><p>Fatima Farouk Elsheikh El Toum, secretary general of the boards of directors and governors of BADEA, said that getting more women on boards required a mindset shift - and not just among men, but also among women in leadership positions. She urged women leaders to be more assertive and confident in their abilities.</p><p>\"You need to have the feeling that you can lead, you can thrive, you don't have to be apologetic for who you are. It is never something that is handed to you: it has to be demanded. We're not usually granted opportunities,\" she said on a panel during the MoU signing ceremony.</p><p>The panel explored strategies to increase women's access to executive roles, board seats, and institutional presidencies, highlighting concrete solutions to close the gender gap in decision-making spaces.</p><p>She highlighted the need for more public and private investment in education, arguing that this was the key to arming women with the power to lead major organisations.</p><p>\"We have to believe that we are part of the making of the future and we have to make sure that this continent is offering girls quality education that can make them future leaders. Without education we will not reach our vision,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's on us to create the opportunity for the next generation. We must ensure there is quality education so that we can bring a woman [into a boardroom] who is equally competent and able to speak to the chairperson of a corporation and tell him 'no'.\"</p><p>Speaking on the same panel, Mitwa Gambi, CEO of MTN Côte d'Ivoire, delved into how African women in business can ascend to positions of leadership and responsibility much quicker. \"You must have self-belief and a support network,\" she said. She also highlighted the importance of networking to find mentors. \"It's not always about formal mentorship. Take advantage of the people you meet.\"</p><p>Gambi added that in addition to the right attitude and right network, women leaders needed to invest in themselves - to boost their skills, knowledge and understanding of their field.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharpen your craft</h2><p>\"Ultimately you have to be great at what you do. You need to sharpen your craft, going to bed knowing something new each day,\" she said.</p><p>Toyin Sani, founder of the Emerging Africa Group investment organisation, recounted her journey establishing the group seven years ago, stressing that it was important for women leaders to embrace risk.</p><p>\"Courage is of critical importance. We must change our attitude towards risk taking. I left a high-paying job in a listed investment bank.</p><p>\"Today I employ around 120 people and we've helped raise more than $1bn for our clients,\" Toyin said.</p><p>She added that her firm is keen on creating a working environment where women's contributions can be seen and rewarded.</p><p>\"We have set up an environment to groom women in leadership positions. Key roles such as the head of risk management and our CFO are now women,\" she said.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Promoting inclusion</h2><p>Monique Nsanzabaganwa, former deputy chairperson of the AUC, underlined the crucial role of the private sector in levelling the playing field for women in Africa. </p><p>\"Our aspirations to empower women will remain a vision and a statement until the private sector is involved. Jobs are created in the private sector.</p><p>She welcomed the move by an increasing number of companies to report on women's representation in the workforce, noting that accountability was key in ensuring progress in advancing gender equality in the private sector.</p><p>\"Reporting on women representation in board and management by the private sector is key.

As we speak we have seen how the number of women in boards and executive and CEO positions has grown [as a result of reporting].\"</p><p>Nasseneba Toure, minister of women, family and children of Côte d'Ivoire, stressed the need for an inclusive approach that doesn't leave behind women in rural areas, particularly those working in agriculture.</p><p>\"Supporting women is key for Africa's prosperity.

      "description": "",
      "content": "<p>Sidi Ould Tah's election to the helm of the African Development Bank (AfDB) in May comes at a pivotal moment for Africa's biggest multilateral lender. Africa is grappling with a worsening funding crisis and the increasingly urgent need to assert its economic independence amid fraying global multilateral cooperation.</p><p>Many African governments face severe fiscal constraints, squeezed by dwindling donor support, limited budgetary room and crippling debt repayments. These pressures have forced leaders to make tough choices about where and how to spend limited funds, with critical programmes in healthcare, education and infrastructure bearing the brunt of budget cuts.</p><p>Financing to address the climate crisis is also in alarmingly short supply, with a recent Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) report finding that only about 23% of the estimated annual funding required to meet the 2030 climate goals in Africa is currently being met.</p><p>African leaders are looking to the AfDB to help them not only confront these pressing challenges, but also reset Africa's development paradigm by helping countries to transition from aid dependency to investment-driven economic growth.</p><p>\"Tah's agenda will revolve around shifting the bank from an aid provider to an investment catalyst,\" wrote Jacques Emmanuel Attoumbre, an analyst at Concerto, based in Paris.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Arab backing</h2><p>Attoumbre credits Tah's victory in the elections to \"widespread support and [the] backing of the Arab world\".</p><p>Tah secured 76.18% of the total vote and 72.37% of regional votes in the third round of voting, defeating Zambia's Samuel Maimbo, Senegal's Amadou Hott, Chad's Abbas Mahamat Tolli and South Africa's Swazi Tshabalala.</p><p>The winning candidate must get 50.01% of both the regional and total vote. The bank's shareholder base includes 54 African countries and 27 non-African countries.</p><p>\"While he was the last to declare his candidacy, his bid was supported by a coalition of African and Arab countries, notably Saudi Arabia, which lobbied Arab League members,\" Attoumbre noted.</p><p>Tah, who has four decades of experience in international finance, is the outgoing president of the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and a former economy minister for Mauritania. Attoumbre believes that his track record at BADEA strongly appealed to shareholders.</p><p>\"His strong track record at the BADEA - where he more than tripled the institution's capital over his presidency and secured the second-best credit rating, a notch below the coveted AAA rating - also played in his favour,\" he says. The bank is rated double A-plus by Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch and the Japanese Credit Rating Agency.</p><p>\"It's too early to tell whether he can replicate the wins of his tenure at the helm of the BADEA. The litmus test of his mandate will likely be how successfully he can secure billions of dollars from the Gulf to support Africa's development,\" he adds.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Renewed optimism</h2><p>Frannie Léautier, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, observed that Tah's election had brought about a \"renewed sense of optimism\".</p><p>\"As Tah's campaign manager, I witnessed firsthand how his platform evolved - and how shareholders ultimately rallied behind him,\" she said.</p><p>\"Tah's decisive victory reflects a desire among shareholders for a leader with a track record of institutional transformation and financial innovation,\" she added.</p><p>With the US proposing to cut $555m in funding for the AfDB, shareholders opted for a candidate who could mobilise alternative funding, she argued.</p><p>\"Tah is expected to enhance domestic resource mobilisation and implement innovative financial instruments. He is also slated to strengthen partnerships and diversify funding sources, especially with emerging powers such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and others, to secure needed resources for the continent's development agenda,\" she noted.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Passing the baton with confidence</h2><p>Tah will take the reins of the AfDB in September, succeeding Nigeria's Akinwumi Adesina who focused on growing the bank's balance sheet and improving its development impact. Under his leadership AfDB's capital grew from $93bn in 2015 to $319bn in 2025.</p><p>\"This expansion enabled unprecedented financial support to African countries, with $102bn in approvals over the past 10 years, accounting for 46% of all approvals since the bank's inception in 1964,\" he said at the closing ceremony of the AfDB annual meetings in Abidjan, his last as president.</p><p>\"These are not just numbers. They represent transformative impacts across Africa,\" he said, noting that the bank's initiatives in areas like electricity, water and sanitation, food security, healthcare and transport had impacted 565m Africans over the past decade.</p><p>\"As I prepare to pass the baton I do so with confidence. I am proud to leave behind a very strong financial institution that can weather any storms,\" he told journalists at the AfDB annual meetings. Adesina expressed confidence that, with Tah, the bank was in \"good and safe hands\".</p><p>\"Sidi is mature, experienced and competent. The bank is in good and safe hands,\" he posted on social media platform X.</p><p>Adesina is charismatic and outspoken, while Tah is seen as having a more reserved demeanour. Yet, personalities aside, the two seem to share the same passion for results and determination to see Africa succeed in a world where the odds are not always stacked in its favour.</p><p>The road ahead for Tah will be challenging as he embarks on his five-year term as president of Africa's largest development finance institution. He will have to knock on multiple doors to secure new funds and offset the shrinking contributions of Africa's main donors.</p><p>He will also have to re-engineer processes at the AfDB to help it move with greater speed and agility in view of Africa's expanding development needs. It's certainly not going to be a walk in the park, but Tah is confident that he will deliver on his vision.</p><p>\"I extend my deepest gratitude to all who supported me - regional and non-regional members of the bank and the leaders and countries that they represent. This marks the beginning of a challenging yet inspiring journey - together, we will drive Africa's transformation with unity, ambition and purpose,\" he posted on X after the election results were announced.</p>",

Through fractional ownership, co-owners access a set number of nights for personal use or rentals, managed by Partment’s Smart Booking System. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Vacation homes are a dream for many people; real estate ownership in general is an aspiration for a lot of people. However, it requires strong guidance, a large investment ticket, and time to decide what to buy and prepare it accordingly. Resulting in only one per cent of the population being able to afford them,” said Nadim Nagui, co-founder of Partment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Also, these vacation homes, or second homes, are only used for 10-20 per cent of the year. This efficiency gap is the core problem that inspired the co-founders to solve today. Our mission is to allow more people to invest in second homes seamlessly, so we have created a new real estate category, which is co-ownership.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-ownership, Nagui says, is the “missing link” between the traditional options of complete ownership and rental arrangements for second homes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This gap became apparent due to the high costs associated with complete ownership and the limited use of second homes,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partment <a href=\"https://disrupt-africa.com/2022/10/07/egyptian-prop-tech-startup-partment-raises-1-5m-funding/\">closed a pre-seed round of US$1.5 million</a> n September 2022, led by Nclude and Plus Venture Capital, but Nagui said one of its most remarkable landmarks thus far was establishing a partnership with ValU, a prominent financing solution in the region, renowned as a leader in the “buy now pay later” market. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This collaboration has enabled us to introduce a smoother and more seamless experience when co-owning vacation homes,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The response has been incredible. We initially began with just 2-3 properties, but the market&#8217;s positive reaction spurred us on, and now we offer 10+ properties. Remarkably, 25 per cent of our customers join us through referrals, and 15 per cent own more than one share with us. These statistics solidly demonstrate that our solution not only works but fulfills a genuine need for many individuals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partment began its journey in Gouna, delving into the vibrant Red Sea locale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Within just one year, we spread our wings to the North Coast, Egypt&#8217;s beloved summer hotspot, and Somabay, an exciting extension of our presence along the Red Sea shores. Now, we&#8217;re thrilled to <a href=\"https://disrupt-africa.com/2023/12/04/egyptian-prop-tech-startup-partment-expands-to-greece/\">announce our very first international expansion into Athens, Greece</a>, marking the start of our global journey with more exciting destinations on the horizon,” Nagui said.</span></p>",

This event has implications for both the Bitcoin market and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, including altcoins. The halving event reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, cutting the rewards for miners in half. While it is challenging to determine the exact impact the Bitcoin halving will have on the crypto landscape, some analysts believe the halving can generate increased attention on altcoins and influence market dynamics.</span></p>\n<p><b>Why is the crypto market shifting towards Altcoins?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and various factors can contribute to shifts in crypto preferences. Here are some of the reasons why crypto aficionados may seek out altcoins:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Altcoin Innovation:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, with new projects introducing innovative technologies and features. Some crypto fans may diversify their portfolios by exploring alternative coins (altcoins) that offer unique functionalities beyond what Bitcoin provides. For example, </span><a href=\"https://apemax.co/?ref=da_19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeMax</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s novel “Boost-to-Earn” staking protocol is generating excitement amongst many crypto enthusiasts.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Layer-2 Solutions and Scaling:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some blockchains focus on addressing scalability issues and improving transaction speeds through Layer-2 solutions. These efforts aim to provide more efficient alternatives to Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain for certain use cases.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Affordability: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some enthusiasts are drawn to altcoins due to their lower nominal prices compared to Bitcoin. While it&#8217;s essential to consider market capitalization and supply metrics, the affordability of certain altcoins can make them more appealing to those who may not be able to afford Bitcoin in 2024. For instance, both Skale and </span><a href=\"https://apemax.co/?ref=da_19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeMax</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offer tokens priced below $1.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Final Thoughts on Trending Altcoins</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we journey through 2024, the crypto market presents a blend of well-established altcoins and emerging players like </span><a href=\"https://apemax.co/?ref=da_19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ApeMax</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, showcasing innovation at affordable prices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating the dynamic crypto market requires a prudent mindset, acknowledging the inherent volatility and risks associated with any token.

It&#8217;s been a rough road for XRP over the past year as the crypto&#8217;s owner, Ripple, has been caught up in a long-standing legal battle with the SEC, causing XRP to sit in the shadows of its former glory back in 2021-2022. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the tide is turning. XRP exhibits promise in potentially prevailing in the lawsuit, attracting crypto whales who are seizing the opportunity in the bearish market to acquire XRP at its low point. Despite this potential, the uncertainty surrounding the Ripple SEC lawsuit makes XRP more of a speculative venture than a straightforward investment.

In a crypto market filled with Doge-based meme coins, many are curious about what makes LHINU stand out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The standout feature of LHINU is its blockchain-based voting system.

This strategic move, coupled with Uniswap&#8217;s robust infrastructure, led to a remarkable 320% surge within a mere 12 hours, indicating early market recognition.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a consistent trading value, </span><a href=\"https://dosestun.care/b_sponge-v2-en_53466\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPONGE</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has gathered a community of over 11,000 token holders and attracted a social following exceeding 30,000. The coin&#8217;s trading volume exceeds $393,000, and over $1.6 million worth of SPONGE has been staked to bridge to the new V2 token.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sponge V2 aims to tap into the P2E potential, drawing inspiration from successful initiatives like Decentraland. While Decentraland focuses on virtual real estate, SPONGE plans to immerse gamers in the imaginative world of Bikini Bottom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This new crypto game, powered by SPONGE V2 tokens, allows players to engage in races with friends, contributing to the emerging trend of P2E experiences within the crypto space.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operated as an Ethereum-based coin using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, SPONGE allocates over 51% of its </span><a href=\"https://dosestun.care/b_sponge-v2-en_53466\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPONGEV2</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> token supply to staking and P2E rewards. SPONGE seeks to integrate meme culture with crypto innovation, providing users with engaging P2E experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the crypto market approaches the upcoming altcoin season in 2024, Sponge V2&#8217;s exploration of Play-to-Earn mechanisms stands out as a noteworthy development, aligning with the broader trend of utility-driven initiatives in the meme coin space.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-34699\" height=\"729\" src=\"http://disrupt-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sponge-Tokeomics.png\" width=\"1509\" /></p>\n<h2><b>Are Crypto Presales a Worthy Investment?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allure of crypto presales lies in their potential for early access and explosive growth. Snagging discounted tokens before a meme coin skyrockets can be undeniably tempting but it’s arguably more important to analyse meme coin roadmaps as a priority.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, identifying promising meme coins amidst market saturation involves monitoring unique meme coin project features, rather than simply rushing to buy into presales.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love Hate Inu, Shiba Inu, DigiToads, Evil Pepe Coin and Sponge V2 stand out with diverse offerings, from decentralised voting to Play-to-Earn initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potential investors exploring SPONGEV2 find themselves in a favourable position to grab a meme coin in its early phases, that has as much ambition as established meme coins such as SHIB. The current price of SPONGE is set at $0.0008159. The acquisition of </span><a href=\"https://dosestun.care/b_sponge-v2-en_53466\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SPONGEV2</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is facilitated through transactions in ETH, USDT and Card payments on the official website.</span></p>",
